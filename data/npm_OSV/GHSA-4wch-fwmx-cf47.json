  "summary": "Directory Traversal in augustine",
  "details": "Affected versions of `augustine` resolve relative file paths, resulting in a directory traversal vulnerability. A malicious actor can use this vulnerability to access files outside of the intended directory root, which may result in the disclosure of private files on the vulnerable system.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n```http\nGET //etc/passwd HTTP/1.1\nhost:foo\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo direct patch is available at this time. \n\nCurrently, the best mitigation for this flaw is to use a different, functionally equivalent static file server package.",
