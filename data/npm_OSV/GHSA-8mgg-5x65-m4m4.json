  "summary": "Command Injection in soletta-dev-app",
  "details": "All versions of `soletta-dev-app` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package does not validate user input on the `/api/service/status` API endpoint, passing contents of the `service` query parameter to an exec call. This may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.",
