  "summary": "Command Injection in ascii-art",
  "details": "Versions of `ascii-art` before 1.4.4 are vulnerable to command injection. This is exploitable when user input is passed into the argument of the `ascii-art preview` command. \n\n\nExample Proof of concept:\n`ascii-art preview 'doom\"; touch /tmp/malicious; echo \"'`\n\nGiven that the input is passed on the command line and none of the api methods are vulnerable to this,  the likely exploitation vector is when the ascii-art comment is being called programmatically using something like `execFile`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.4.4 or later.",
