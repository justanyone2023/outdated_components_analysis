  "details": "All versions of `markdown` are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The `markdown.toHTML()` function has significantly degraded performance when parsing long strings containing underscores. This may lead to Denial of Service if the parser accepts user input.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
