  "summary": "Denial of Service in uap-core",
  "details": "## Impact\n\nSome regexes are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (REDoS) due to overlapping capture groups. This allows remote attackers to overload a server by setting the User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long strings.\n\n## Patches\n\nPlease update uap-core to >= v0.11.0\n\nDownstream packages such as uap-python, uap-ruby etc which depend upon uap-core follow different version schemes.",
