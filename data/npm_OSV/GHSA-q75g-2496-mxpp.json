  "summary": "Regular Expression Denial of Service in parsejson",
  "details": "Affected versions of `parsejson` are vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service when parsing untrusted user input.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe `parsejson` package has not been functionally updated since it was initially released.\n\nAdditionally, it provides functionality which is natively included in Node.js, and therefore the native `JSON.parse()` should be used, for both performance and security reasons.",
