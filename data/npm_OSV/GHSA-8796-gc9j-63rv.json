  "summary": "File upload local preview can run embedded scripts after user interaction",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen uploading a file, the local file preview can lead to execution of scripts embedded in the uploaded file, but only after several user interactions to open the preview in a separate tab. This only impacts the local user while in the process of uploading. It cannot be exploited remotely or by other users.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been fixed by https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/5981, which is included in 3.21.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds.",
