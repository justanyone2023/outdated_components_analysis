  "summary": "Signature Verification Bypass in jwt-simple",
  "details": "Versions of `jwt-simple` prior to 0.5.3 are vulnerable to Signature Verification Bypass. If no algorithm is specified in the `decode()` function, the packages uses the algorithm in the JWT to decode tokens. This allows an attacker to create a HS256 (symmetric algorithm) JWT with the server's public key as secret, and the package will verify it as HS256 instead of RS256 (asymmetric algorithm).\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 0.5.3 or later.",
