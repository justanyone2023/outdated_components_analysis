  "summary": "HTML injection in search results via plaintext message highlighting",
  "details": "### Impact\nPlain text messages containing HTML tags are rendered as HTML in the search results. To exploit this, an attacker needs to trick a user into searching for a specific message containing an HTML injection payload.\n\nCross-site scripting is possible by including resources from `recaptcha.net` and `gstatic.com` which are included in the default CSP.\n\nThanks to [Cadence Ember](https://cadence.moe/) for finding the injection and to [S1m](https://github.com/p1gp1g/) for finding possible XSS vectors.\n\n### Patches\nVersion 3.71.0 of the SDK fixes the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nRestarting the client will clear the injection.",
