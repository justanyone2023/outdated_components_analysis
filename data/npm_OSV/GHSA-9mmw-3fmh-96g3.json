  "summary": "Malicious Package in calk",
  "details": "All versions of `calk` typosquatted a popular package of similar name and tracked users who had installed the incorrect package. The package uploaded information to a remote server including: name of the downloaded package, name of the intended package, the Node version and whether the process was running as sudo. There is no further compromise.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nRemove the package from your dependencies and always ensure package names are typed correctly upon installation.",
