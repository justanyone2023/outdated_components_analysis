  "summary": "Malicious Package in eslint-config-airbnb-standard",
  "details": "Version 2.0.0 of `eslint-config-airbnb-standard` was published with a bundled version of `eslint-scope` that  was found to contain malicious code. This code would read the users `.npmrc` file and send it's contents to a remote server.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe best course of action if you found this package installed in your environment is to revoke all your npm tokens and use a different version of the module. You can find instructions on how to do that here. https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/working_with_tokens#how-to-revoke-tokens\n",
