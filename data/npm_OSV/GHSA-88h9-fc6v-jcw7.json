  "summary": "Unintended Require in larvitbase-www",
  "details": "All versions of `larvitbase-www` are vulnerable to an Unintended Require. The package exposes an API endpoint and passes a GET parameter unsanitized to an `require()` call. This allows attackers to execute any `.js` file in the same folder as the server is running.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
