  "summary": "Prototype Pollution in lodash",
  "details": "Versions of `lodash` before 4.17.5 are vulnerable to prototype pollution. \n\nThe vulnerable functions are 'defaultsDeep', 'merge', and 'mergeWith' which allow a malicious user to modify the prototype of `Object` via `{constructor: {prototype: {...}}}` causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 4.17.11 or later.",
