  "summary": "Authentication Bypass in otpauth",
  "details": "Versions of `otpauth` prior to 3.2.8 are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass. The package's `totp.validate()` function may return positive values for single digit tokens even if they are invalid. This may allow attackers to bypass the OTP authentication by providing single digit tokens.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 3.2.8 or later.",
