  "summary": "Arbitrary File Write in bin-links",
  "details": "Versions of `bin-links` prior to 1.1.5 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write. The package fails to restrict access to folders outside of the intended `node_modules` folder through the `bin` field. This allows attackers to create arbitrary files in the system. Note it is not possible to overwrite files that already exist.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.1.5 or later.",
