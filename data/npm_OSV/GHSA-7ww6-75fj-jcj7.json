  "summary": "Cross-site Scripting in Auth0 Lock",
  "details": "### Overview\n\nIn versions before and including `11.32.2`, when the \u201cadditional signup fields\u201d feature [is configured](https://github.com/auth0/lock#additional-sign-up-fields), a malicious actor can inject invalidated HTML code into these additional fields, which is then stored in the service `user_metdata` payload (using the `name` property).\n\nVerification emails, when applicable, are generated using this metadata. It is therefor possible for an actor to craft a malicious link by injecting HTML, which is then rendered as the recipient's name within the delivered email template.\n\n### Am I affected?\nYou are impacted by this vulnerability if you are using `auth0-lock` version `11.32.2` or lower and are using the \u201cadditional signup fields\u201d feature in your application.\n\n### How to fix that?\nUpgrade to version `11.33.0`.\n\n### Will this update impact my users?\nAdditional signup fields that have been added to the signup tab on Lock will have HTML tags stripped from user input from version `11.33.0` onwards. The user will not receive any validation warning or feedback, but backend data will no longer include HTML.",
