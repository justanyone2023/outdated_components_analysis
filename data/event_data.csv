Thanks for reporting the issue. I will document this a bit better to avoid the confusion in the future. For reference, Turf follows the [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html) spec for all data, which specifies x,y,z encoding.

> A position is represented by an array of numbers. There must be at least two elements, and may be more. The order of elements must follow x, y, z order (easting, northing, altitude for coordinates in a projected coordinate reference system, or longitude, latitude, altitude for coordinates in a geographic coordinate reference system).

The `which brew >/dev/null 2>&1 && eval $(brew --env) && echo $PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR` part of PKG_CONFIG_PATH is applicable for Macs only. We need to work out a portable way of making Windows ignore any error it generates, like the `|| true` command does for Linux.

Ember.ObjectController (and Ember.ArrayController) will be deprecated in Ember 1.11 (and removed from core in Ember 2.0). The reasoning is detailed in the Ember 2.0 RFC.

This PR does the following:

* Updates templates/controllers/views to explicitly reference model properties (instead of relying on proxying behavior).
* Clearly delineate where certain properties are being set or retrieved from (for example it was not clear exactly where `scratch` and `titleScratch` were stored).
* Remove usage of `Ember.ObjectController`.
* Add JSCS rule to prevent future PR's from adding regressions.

Solution 1:
Add the same image to template content and hide it with style display:none. Then you can add it to the header and it will show up because it is already cached and no async request is needed.

Solution 2:
Use base64 encoding and Data URI scheme to embed image directly.

Karma is a wonderful spec runner. However, it is kinda design to work with AngularJS. I'm at the moment exploring various ways of testing client side code. Some frameworks (or apps) require having `<script>` or HTML tags on the page in order to work. I'm using TODOMVC as a example and I'm trying to test it by using different tools. This PR introduces one more property to the `client` configuration item.
```
module.exports = function(config) {
  config.set({

    // base path that will be used to resolve all patterns (eg. files, exclude)
    basePath: '',


    client: {
      contextFile: '/TestRunner.html'
    },

    ...
```
The content of the `TestRunner.html` is the same as the content of `static/context.html`. The only one difference is that I added what I needed there. In my case this was a Backbone app and I placed the templates along with the application's HTML. Here is how my test suite looks like:

That is: launcher, preprocessor, reporter.

Btw, I like the idea of collecting all errors and then failing, so that user sees all the errors and not only the first one.

Here are all the places where Karma instantiate plugins and thus a fatal error can happen (in order in which it happens):
1. Loading plugins (loading the DI modules):
https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/6d5330981b13a1df75f1037ded532429cabd77cb/lib/server.js#L310
2. Instantiate reporters
https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/51f1b8832b86c4f556b58381fa183776212cfaa7/lib/reporter.js#L85
3. Instantiating frameworks (inside `start` function):
https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/6d5330981b13a1df75f1037ded532429cabd77cb/lib/server.js#L30
4. Start browsers (after the webserver is ready listening):
https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/6d5330981b13a1df75f1037ded532429cabd77cb/lib/server.js#L69
5. Instantiate preprocessors (this happens lazily, once the preprocessor is needed; we need to change that and instantiate all needed preprocessors ahead, inside `createPreprocessor` factory)
https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/6d5330981b13a1df75f1037ded532429cabd77cb/lib/preprocessor.js#L88

Thus, I would add the check into the [webserver listener](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/6d5330981b13a1df75f1037ded532429cabd77cb/lib/server.js#L72), after launching browsers (), and fail Karma if any error occurred. At that point, all of the plugins were instantiated, except preprocessors. We need to change preprocessors to instantiate all needed preprocessors ahead (in the `createPreprocessor` factory), instead of lazily.


I'm sorry this is confusing. I think it would be good to refactor Karma to instantiate everything first. Right now, ""instantiating things"" is kind of tangled together with bootstrapping (this is probably more efficient, but harder to understand). I wish I did it differently;-)

Yes it has, but now I can't access the blog and get forbidden, so I tried setting urlSSL manual in some variants. With punycode, without punycode, with \u for unicode chars. Nothing made it to work.

I think it might be better to just show a warning when the user misconfigures `--log-level`. It won't affect Karma. This is different from failing to instantiate a preprocessor or launcher (we should fail in that case, because it might pass the tests - a browser that would fail didn't start).

Note: This prints `Sequelize [Node: 0.10.29, CLI: 1.0.2, ORM: 2.0.0-rc4]`
Note 2: I created a user `test` with the password `test123` on my windows machine and also database `sequelizeclitest`.
Note 3: I copied and pasted the config file from your previous comment into my `config/config.json` so I'm using exactly the same file as you do.

Ember.ObjectController (and Ember.ArrayController) will be deprecated in Ember 1.11 (and removed from core in Ember 2.0). The reasoning is detailed in the Ember 2.0 RFC.

This PR does the following:

* Updates templates/controllers/views to explicitly reference model properties (instead of relying on proxying behavior).
* Clearly delineate where certain properties are being set or retrieved from (for example it was not clear exactly where `scratch` and `titleScratch` were stored).
* Remove usage of `Ember.ObjectController`.
* Add JSCS rule to prevent future PR's from adding regressions.

The plugin simply delegates to the [`source-map-support` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support).

Things are still less than ideal.  The debugger doesn't generate clickable links for compiled sources.  I'll see if there's a way to address this.

Not sure if this will work for other cases, but it is working well for me when using [`karma-browserify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma-browserify) to generate bundles before tests run.","[PR please, type: feature]","[207de5, 02e10c]","[0, 0]","[, ]",46647,vojtajina,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2014-01-20 01:38:41,2015-01-02 22:17:11,4,,68567853,2015-01-02 22:17:11,2015-01-02 22:17:11,COLLABORATOR,41094,tschaub,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

I'm not sure what is the cause of the issue is.

Long story: Here is how Karma works:
It starts the webserver, once the webserver is listening on given port, start browsers.
A browser opens `/` url, the webserver serves `static/client.html` for that url, which establishes socket.io connection - the browser is captured. Responding to this request does not wait for resolving the files.

When a test run starts, all browsers refresh an iframe with actual tests. This iframe points to `/context.html`. Webserver does delay serving of `/context.html`, until the `file_list` promise is resolved (it needs updated list of files in order to generate the `/context.html` response).

**Thus, capturing of the browser is not delayed until the files are resolved.**

I'm not sure what the actual cause of your problem is. Sounds like the Karma process is too busy resolving all the files (and possibly preprocessing them) and the webserver does not get scheduled to handle the requests from browser. Can you try it with some GUI browser, eg. Chrome and check out the timeline - how long does it take to serve the initial `/` request, including its resources (such as `static/karma.js`, socket.io, etc)? Then the browser sends a message (through socket.io), ""register"", how long does that message take? Also, how many files do you have (I would like to reproduce the issue? 
 
Let's figure out what the cause is and then we can fix it properly.

Can you open the timeline in the browser
This PR will make capturing browsers much slower (waiting for all files to be resolved and then starting browsers; it takes significant time for the browser to actually open the url).

So I think that the source-map-support configuration is not correct when used with Cucumber js, but this should be fixed in another PR I reckon.

Long story short, as far as I understand the closest analogy to explicit waits for expected conditions is using `browser.wait()`. 

In [python-selenium](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/waits.html#explicit-waits) or [java-selenium](https://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/ExpectedConditions.html), there are multiple built-in commonly used expected conditions shortcuts, like:

 * [text_to_be_present_in_element_value](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions.text_to_be_present_in_element_value)
 * [invisibility_of_element_located](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions.invisibility_of_element_located)
 * [title_is](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions.title_is)

Is it possible to have these shortcuts built-in to protractor? Or, if not, what would be the appropriate way to implement it and use with protractor?

Thanks for that excellent summary. I think I understand the whole process a lot better now!

I'll follow your suggestions and post the results next week. Also, I'll try to build a small repo to trigger the problem.

Sounds like the Karma process is too busy resolving all the files (and possibly preprocessing them) and the webserver does not get scheduled to handle the requests from browser. Can you try it with some GUI browser, eg. Chrome and check out the timeline - how long does it take to serve the initial / request, including its resources (such as static/karma.js, socket.io, etc)? Then the browser sends a message (through socket.io), ""register"", how long does that message take? Also, how many files do you have (I would like to reproduce the issue?

I've written a [plugin](https://github.com/Rovak/InlineAttachment) which allows users to paste content from the clipboard in a textarea or editors like CodeMirror. This plugin can be used, or only use the code which is relevant for the textarea editor.

Right now most browsers lack the support for listening to `paste` events, only Chrome supports it natively, Firefox works with some ugly hacks. I'm also not sure how pasting images would work on mobile.

If this feature is accepted then i can implement it and base it on #4373.

`Feature` can't be used anywhere that only gets one chance to ""get"" its computed properties.

However I think that there is a way that this could be achieve now (waiting for a more comprehensive implementation.
Let me explain:
in the read operation , there is a need to fetch a fresh value of the variable asynchronously and wait for the callback to be called prior to returning the requested node value in the opcua request.
However, in the write operation we could imagine that the opcua write request simply initiates an asynchronous write operation and returns immediately without waiting for the asynchronous write op to be completed.

In this case the code would look like:

```javascript
  server.engine.addVariableInFolder(myDevices, {
        browseName: ""Temperature"",
        nodeId: ""ns=2;s=Temperature"",
        dataType: ""Double"",

        value: {
            refreshFunc: function (callback) {

                var temperature = 20 + 10 * Math.sin(Date.now() / 10000);
                var value = new Variant({dataType: DataType.Double, value: temperature});
                var sourceTimestamp = new Date();

                // simulate a asynchronous behaviour
                setTimeout(function () {
                    callback(null, value, sourceTimestamp);
                }, 100);
            }
            set: function(value) {
                  startAsyncWrite(value,function unused_callback(err,data){});
            }
        }

Would you entertain the thought of adding a similar ""refreshWriteFunc"" capability to the OPCUA server:


// write services
OPCUAServer.prototype._on_WriteRequest = function (message, channel) {

    var server = this;

    var request = message.request;
    assert(request instanceof WriteRequest);
    assert(_.isArray(request.nodesToWrite));

        assert(request.nodesToWrite[0]._schema.name === ""WriteValue"");

    server.engine.refreshWriteValues(request.nodesToWrite,function(err,data){

		   results: results,
		   diagnosticInfos: null
	    });
	    channel.send_response(""MSG"", response, message);
    
    });
    
};


This refreshWriteFunc would also need to allow the return of response codes (like errors) to override the response code that was returned from the simple set function.

Something like this I have no doubt will be created some day, but it will most likely be once Apps are available. @PaulAdamDavis is working on the dashboard right now, dont know if there is a timeline for that, but once that is out, and then apps are out, this should be able to be created as an app and then installed onto the dashboard.

I know that the plan is to have some built in stats for the dashboard, but any tie ins to google analytics will prob be app territory.

Hope that helps,

Reading the docs, it does only say that pre/post `resize()` would matter, but I think it's fair to expect that someone would want pre/post `rotate()` as well.

Sample code:
```
  var e = sharp(imagePath)
  	.rotate(img.rotation)
//        .resize(img.masterWidth, img.masterHeight)
        .extract(region.top, region.left, region.width, region.height);
  console.log('extract options', e.options);
  e
    .toFile(output);
```

If you run this without the `resize()` you'll see that the extract options have Pre offsets, even though it's chained after the rotation. (Moving `extract()` before the rotation gives the same output.) A work-around is to resize to the full dimensions before the extract.

I use ghost with the ""fileStorage: false"" option in my config due to the use of ephemeral storage and I noticed when using the tag management panel the section where an image is added has some odd behavior.

Initially there are multiple submit boxes and buttons for what presumably should simply be one box for the URL and a submit button.. But, even more interesting is if one clicks away out of this tag-info section and moves to another tag, and then another tag after that.. the URL boxes and submit buttons keep building up.

If one clicks away to another section, such as 'General' or 'Users' and returns to the 'tags' section to again click on a tag to edit its tag-info section, it returns to the initial errant amount of URL boxes and submit buttons.

this is happening on 0.5.7 with a postgres database and filestorage disabled.
 
here are some images showing first the initial state, and second what happens after navigating to a few other tags:

As we roll these out people are going to want to play with them, and we ***want*** people playing with these new features in advance, finding bugs, discovering usability issues etc.

So how about, as well as having a config flag, we make a 'Ghost Labs' page that provides the ability to turn on these options. The Ghost Labs page would be a hidden page a lot like our Ugly Debug Tools, that would simply live at `/settings/labs/` with no internal link.

We can add a 'labs' setting to the settings DB that stores a JSON object with a boolean value for each feature we add to the page and whether it's on or off - which overrides the config value.

This might be a teeny bit fiddly to implement, but I think it could be a lot of fun, and a great way to get more feedback on features whilst they are in development. It would give us a space to try things out that we aren't sure about, or provide different potential solutions and experiment a little bit with what works best in practice.

The Tag Settings Menu that is activated upon navigating to the Tags section of Settings shows multiple URL input boxes and multiple submit buttons if the ""fileStorage: false"" config option is set. 

When navigating to other tags in the Tags section of Settings the total amount of URL input boxes and submit buttons increases on each tag that one navigates to. 

When navigating away from the Tags section of Settings (example: going to Users) and returning to the Tags section and navigating to the TSM for a tag the initial number of errant URL input boxes returns.
 
### Steps to Reproduce

Set the ""fileStorage: false"" setting in config.js. Enable ""tagsUI: true"" in config.js. 

Go to Ghost Admin page and navigate to Settings -> Tags. Select a tag to activate the Tag Settings Menu slide-out. See the Tag Image Field being displayed improperly as in the first attached image.

Select a different tag from the one initially selected from within the Tags section of Settings to enable the Tag Settings Menu slide-out once again. See that the number of URL fields and Submit buttons has increased as in the second attached image.

The correct behavior should be one that matches the rest of Ghost while the ""fileStorage: false"" setting is being utilized: One URL field and One Submit button.

That's fine, but what you didn't do was given us time to get deprecated notices sorted.. Afaik you didn't even provide a version w/ notices saying methods would be deprecated..  

Please re-release a new version that has support for V1 and maybe give us a few months to change our packages to reflect the v2 api..

I see you've got both an issue and a PR, and you've closed the issue in favour of the PR but I'm commenting here because the issue is really the best place to discuss the merits of the feature request, and also we usually use GitHub's features to close an issue with a PR if it is decided it's something we want to add. 

We've got some [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) that might be worth a bit of a read - both in relation to feature requests and the format of your PR, but in short, my main concern here is that neither the issue you've raised not the PR really explain your use case or why it would be worthwhile to add this extra level of complexity to Ghost.

There's already a couple of different ways to specify the path to a config file, including passing in a path or setting an environment variable, and there is no discussion of why these are not suitable. Adding yet-another-way to specify config adds quite significant complexity especially when you consider how rare the use case is  - it's something that's easy to end up getting broken in future.

The goal is to have the hinting as a tool that makes it easier to catch bad practices or coding styles we don't prefer.

The (case)[https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib/blob/develop/src/js/ripple/transaction.js#L503] @wltsmrz pointed out doesn't look like great coding practice to me. I'm sure you can use it responsibly but it's hard to read and easy to misunderstand. Allowing assignments where a boolean evaluation is expected should not be a best practice.

For `W004`, I'm not sure if it's more readable to keep `var`. Effectively redefining a var or assigning a previously assigned var doesn't change anything logically, but you might accidentally override a var in your scope you didn't intend to. I expect that to be the reason for jshint to have this option.

Right now we do manual inspection of a pull request to enforce stylistic changes and avoid gotchas. I would like to make the jshint checking part of the test process so it will actually fail the test. That's essentially the same thing as blocking a pull request by a comment for a stylistic change, but now it's automated. It does not replace code review, it's part of the automated tests and makes code reviews a little easier. A certain set of stylistic preferences and gotchas shouldn't come up in code reviews anymore since the hinting will have already caught that.

Agreed

I'm sure you can use it responsibly but it's hard to read and easy to misunderstand. Allowing assignments where a boolean evaluation is expected should not be a best practice.

It's easy to read and hard to misunderstand, to me. It's unlikely that anyone is going to use this without knowing what they're doing. Making jshint more strict in this regard won't catch any bugs

> I would like to make the jshint checking part of the test process so it will actually fail the test. That's essentially the same thing as blocking a pull request by a comment for a stylistic change, but now it's automated.

Bad idea, IMO. You'll still have to review code for style, because jshint is quite lacking. I definitely don't agree with failing tests for jshint.

I have a `/test` endpoint just to test oauth2. I remove the comment in `index.html` to enable oauth2 flow:
```
            initOAuth({
              clientId: ""your-client-id"",
              realm: ""your-realms"",
              appName: ""your-app-name""
            });
```

When I click on the **""on/off""** button to authorize, a new windows browser is opened with the following url `http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui/null&redirect_uri=http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui/o2c.html&realm=your-realms&client_id=your-client-id&scope=s1,s2`.

Note the `null` in the url. It is normal? I'm not super familiar with every aspect of oauth, but I was expecting a popup for username/password and somehow receiving at some endpoint a `POST` with a 
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` in the request body like this:
`grant_type=password&username=johndoe&password=A3ddj3w`

In my case, I am installing Ghost via NPM, and my project directory looks like this:

```
/themes
   /casper
config.js
index.js
package.json
```

I don't want to keep `content` in my repository, because that is dynamically updated on the server, but I do want to keep `themes` in my repository, because that is where I edit the ui of my site.

I found that this change was pretty easy to implement, and I already have it working in a fork. You can see a comparison of the branches here <https://github.com/rchrd2/Ghost/compare/TryGhost:master...master>. I only modified three lines.

While, I found it useful to customize `themePath`, it might be even better to allow all paths to be configured (ie `apps`, `data`, `images`). I can't think of a specific use case, but why not solve this in a general way?

Either way, I can submit a pull request for my `themePath` if that seems okay. I think others might want to make this same change. What do others think?

There have been quite a few talks of using hacks and plugins to enable this temporarily, the browser plugin doesn't seem to be working any more and I've tried adding ```spellcheck=""true""``` as per @eduncan911 's suggestion with no success. 

I understand that there is a work in progress to fix this (which is awesome :+1: ) but is there anything that we can do in the mean time? Even if it is horribly hacky? 

Just a bit of context: I'm Dyslexic and this issue seriously affects me. I have had a reasonably embarrassing experience (which i'm used to) publishing a blog with mistakes in it, but the problem is I was unaware that the spell checker wasn't working. Anything that we can do to warn users would be helpful at this stage before a bigger release. 

When is the https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/4373 due to land? i.e. what release number are we aiming for?

We don't work to any sort of planned releases - we're open source and it simply doesn't work. Right now, I have in mind that there'll be a release very soon with tag management, and the next one should hopefully feature the new editor providing there are no major issues when we merge it in and start testing it properly. 

The best thing anyone can do to help is go to #4373 and follow the instructions to test out the demo of the new editor - @mansona why not compose your posts in the demo editor that has spell check and copy them over afterwards?

I am using Protractor and PhantomJS in a continuous integration process. We build the project on a remote web server and launch E2E tests using Grunt, Protractor and PhantomJS. I am using Jenkins for that. I also use protractor-html-screenshot-reporter to have reports and screenshots when tests failed.

The problem is that even all tests passed (I know it because the reports show me that), sometimes (about 50%) the execution failed because PhantomJS may have died at the end of the tests. It is annoying because, in Jenkins, I am using the return code of the execution to know if the tests passed.

Here is my Protractor configuration

```
var HtmlReporter = require('protractor-html-screenshot-reporter');

exports.config = {

    onPrepare: function() {
        // Add a screenshot reporter and store screenshots to `e2e/debug`:
        jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new HtmlReporter({
            baseDirectory: 'e2e/front/debug',
            takeScreenShotsOnlyForFailedSpecs: true
        }));
    },

    specs: ['spec/**/loginSpec.js', 'spec/**/*Spec.js'],

    baseUrl: 'SOME_URL',

    jasmineNodeOpts: {
        showColors: true,
        defaultTimeoutInterval: 30000
    }
};
```

There've been a lot of different attempts and angles on solving the middleware, and ghost-as-middleware problems, and I've spent significant time myself recently trying to figure out what steps to take to try to improve the core of Ghost core to make everything a bit nicer and specifically - more testable.

Going to cc @gleneivey, @JoshWillik, @hswolff and @jaswilli here - all people who have dived into the murky depths and tried to make Ghost better.

A couple of issues worth referencing as well:

* Good old #827 - we'd love to make Ghost usable as express middleware
* This issue - finishing up the partial refactor of the different express apps inside of Ghost
* The unloved #2182 - optimising Ghost boot (and potentially lazy-loading modules when they are needed rather than intialising everything at the beginning)
* And just for fun mentioning the idea that we'd like more dynamic routing: #4519 - so that routes like /author/ or /tag/ can be customised (and translated).

This is a massive bundle of stuff that I'd like to fix. At the heart of it all, we need to make the internal Ghost modules behave more like modules, and reduce the amount of glue we need to hold everything together. I've been thinking about how to unpick it into stages and I think, wait, know that task is way beyond one person. It would be great to work together to figure out how to rejig the Ghost internals into something simpler.

And I have some ideas.

I wrote a bit reply here which I just deleted as I don't want to overwhelm :) but basically: yes. I walked right into a wall and couldn't go further without pulling up weeds and moving *everything* around which I know you don't want. `/core` needs to be gutted - it's put together in a very ""script-y"" way which means that modules are being treated as includes and everything is bound together.

Moving forward... I think a freeze should go in and a month taken to clean things up. Some ideas I had are:

 - Move modules to a `/lib` directory to keep with Node standards. Move isolated bits (authentication, caching, middleware stuff) into their own repos and reference them in package.json using a Github URL
 - Use an app.js file in the root to do what it's supposed to do: create the express app and configure it by calling into various Ghost modules
 - Simplify `/admin` by sticking the views in the views directory. There's no need to be tricky here, just pop it in there and let it go. No need for a second app either (the problem you encountered RE views missing was actually rather silly and easily fixed by passing an absolute reference to the admin view, not switching the views directory on the fly).

I haven't been closely following the state of the ghost core for a little while, but I'm surprised #827 is still open.
Between the midddleware PR #3849 and the HTTPS bugfix from PR #4435, Ghost has been working as (mounted)middleware on [my site](https://www.joshwillik.com/blog) without issue for quite some time now. Both PRs still pass tests.

This is obviously going to be biased, but I've always felt that my approach to Ghost-as-middleware was the cleanest proposed solution. The **whole** implementation is [26 lines of code](https://github.com/JoshWillik/Ghost/blob/middleware/core/middleware.js). 

The only other real solution I've seen -- #4101 -- separates the boot process into totally different paths: ghost-standalone and ghost-as-middleware. I think this introduces unnecessary code complexity; there is more code surface area and the two paths functionally achieve the same result.

*Sidenote: #4101 bundles a lot of good changes, like being able to pass a config object directly instead of a config file path. I think a lot of the work going into that PR is fantastic. I just don't think it's the right way to go for ghost-as-middleware.*

I don't really have any thoughts on the second two, other than they're both great ideas.
Unfortunately I don't have the time to tackle either right now (unless you're looking for a new employee ;P)

Just my 2 cents.

In other words - a dart-board/target where we could look at files and functional bits and then split out exact tasks?

I think, for instance, that a great first step would be to identify the isolated bits that go into Ghost (off the top of my head): authentication, authorization (role-based stuff), CMS workflow, an HTTP API, a data-access surface, mutable config, the Ember app, caching, update-checker, etc.

Once these are laid out, the next step is moving them to their own modules with their own tests, Gruntfile, package.json, etc.

Once that's complete, then we mesh them all together into Ghost 0.7 :).

I'm happy to take a stab at this along with you and whomever - let's just decide what venue/format. Google docs maybe? I'm open to anything.

Slow down there! (although the last comment you just wrote whilst I was writing this is waaaay more along the lines of what I'm thinking).

I'm starting this conversation so we can gather together concrete ideas on how to move forward **because** the task is big and scary for someone on their own. I strongly believe if we collaborate as a group of smart people, we can come up with a game plan, and a set of steps to get us there. No need for a big freeze or scary rewrite.

@hswolff did some excellent work last year to start moving the ship in the right direction. I think if there's a group of us all working on a plan we'll get there much less painfully.

All that said, let me comment on a couple of things:

@JoshWillik (and @gleneivey) The reason #827 is still open is because there are competing ideas, and it's very difficult to assess which direction is the right one. As you say - there are great ideas in both PRs, but there's also my underlying niggling feeling that the reason it's been so hard to get a sensible solution is due to underlying problems (that are what this discussion is intended to get to the bottom of).

@robconery modules being in the same repo or a different repo is a religious debate and not one we need to have to solve the problem at hand. I think the focus should be on refactoring the code so that each isolated piece acts as a module and is fully testable in its own right. A discussion/decision on whether or not it makes sense to move them out can and should be deferred until we have the luxury of being able to do it ;)

The one bit of clarification however is that breaking modules into their own repos is something you might want to consider sooner, and it's less of a religious decision as it is a long-term one. For instance - I keep bringing up Authentication. If that doesn't change much, then push it out. If you can tweak it ""out of band"" and improve it on its own - it is a fine choice to move to it's own repo. Grunt did just this with its internals (the CLI vs. the runtime).

I do agree, though: first thing is to sketch it out :).

For well-structured stuff, anything in https://github.com/tj is worth looking over.

Perhaps a good example to start on, would be the mailer - surely we can refactor it so it lazy-loads when we need to send mail, rather than initialising it on boot.

I'd be more in favor of following what React has done and allow for usage of sub-modules within Ghost the way you can with React. [For an example look how this Three.js + React project uses modules within React.](https://github.com/Izzimach/react-three/blob/master/src/ReactTHREE.js#L24-33)

This would allow us to get our footing towards isolating individual functionality and still allow it to be exposed such that it could be used by 3rd-party libraries.

IMO the first tangible step towards making Ghost more modular is by shifting all the modules within Ghost to be run on demand, not upon being required and included in another file. I did some work on this, I'm not sure where it was left off however.

But what you said @robconery about Ghost being very ""script-ey"" is very true, and I think just moving away from that as strongly as possible will be a good first step.

Also I do think we need some idea of one top-level coordinator for a Ghost application instance.

You then initialize the bank of modules that you'll need, passing in the app to each (in a constructor or factory, whatever). The module then simply wires up what it needs to do when the app emits certain events.

The hard part here is knowing when these events are finished and when the app can start. Usually it's OK to have these things fire up asyncronously - in other words *is it really necessary to wire up the mail engine and then move on?* - probably not. So, you do the necessaries: load up the middleware, fire up the DB and then start the app.

```
 if ((result = cache[hash])) {
    break;
 }
```
If I look at this case, I'm not sure if the assignment of `result` returns a boolean or if the test is just for a truthy value. In this case the assignment returns a transaction, so it's testing for presence. That's not clear from the snippet, you would have to look elsewhere in the code to see what's going on exactly. IMO this would be more readable and clear:

```
result = cache[hash];
if (result !== void(0)) {
...
```
Or, if you only care about truthy values
```
result = cache[hash];
if (result) {
...
```

I don't really like relying on implicit returns, specially when assigning and testing the result in a statement like this. I would rather be a little more verbose for the sake of clarity. 

I would prefer to take out the `boss` options so we don't write this code, but I care most about agreeing what is a better way to write a case like this. I personally feel the implicit return and assignment in an if case is not the best way.

We've now got autosave working much more reliably, and more importantly if things go wrong it will recover.

Further still, in 0.5.7 we got better session handling on the editor, such that if you get logged out (which is a common problem which interferes with autosave) you get the option to log in again via a modal on the editor, meaning less chance for losses.

However, there's still no warning to the user if autosave isn't working for some reason. A couple of different options were proposed in #4543 and #4558, which centered around the idea that a warning should be displayed if we get more than X failures in a row.

To take directly from @jaswilli's [comment on #4543](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/4543#issuecomment-65112840)

> Instead of a flag indicating that an error has been shown, we could have a counter that gets incremented when auto-save is invoked and is set back to zero after a successful save. That way we could do something like:

```
if ((this.get('saveAttempts') % 5 === 0) && options.silent) {
  // show an error after 5 missed auto-saves
}
```

The main problem with these ideas is that we don't really know what's going on, so it's probably worth thinking about introducing better logging of events in Ghost, and using Ghost(Pro) to build a picture of what's needed. Still I wanted to record this before closing #4543 as something we probably need to do.","[design, ghost-ui]","[90E1CF, B783DE]","[0, 0]","[, ]",101513,ErisDS,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-06 17:28:50,2015-01-06 17:28:50,0,,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

Here's an example in pseudo-code:

```javascript
var app = express();
app.emit(""instantiated"");
//we need some data
var DB = require(""./lib/db"");
//instance the db and
//connect it
app.db = DB.connect(app, connectionString);
```

The only thing we'll probably need right away is to know the DB is connected and we can have the DB module tell us that's the case:

```javascript
var DB = function(){
  var db = {};
  db.connect = function(app, connectionString){
    //psuedo connection code
    client.connect(connectionString, function(err,dbInstance)){
      app.db = dbInstance;
      app.emit(""db-connected"");
    };
  }
  return db;
}

module.exports = DB;
```

in our app.js bootstrapper we can listen for this event:

```javascript
app.on(""db-connected"", function(){
  //we have a db instance on app, so let's do whatever else we need!
  app.mailer = require(""./lib/mailer"").load(app);
  app.auth = require(""./lib/authentication).load(app);
});
```

In this case we have an open DB connection so we're good to go. The only thing I can think of that might need to be done that takes a while is the update check - but that can be handled using sockets and it really doesn't need to go off during startup. 

But, for the sake of argument you could...

```javascript
app.on(""update-checked"", function(updateReady){
  //http.createServer(app).listen...
});

2. save errors are likely not being handled correctly in relation to the beforeunload alert/modal which warns users not to leave if their content isn't saved

I am using Protractor and PhantomJS in a continuous integration process. We build the project on a remote web server and launch E2E tests using Grunt, Protractor and PhantomJS. I am using Jenkins for that. I also use protractor-html-screenshot-reporter to have reports and screenshots when tests failed.

The problem is that even all tests passed (I know it because the reports show me that), sometimes (about 50%) the execution failed because PhantomJS may have died at the end of the tests. It is annoying because, in Jenkins, I am using the return code of the execution to know if the tests passed.

I am using PhantomJS v1.9.8 and Protractor v1.3.1

Here is my Protractor configuration

```
var HtmlReporter = require('protractor-html-screenshot-reporter');

exports.config = {

    onPrepare: function() {
        // Add a screenshot reporter and store screenshots to `e2e/debug`:
        jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new HtmlReporter({
            baseDirectory: 'e2e/front/debug',
            takeScreenShotsOnlyForFailedSpecs: true
        }));
    },

    specs: ['spec/**/loginSpec.js', 'spec/**/*Spec.js'],

    baseUrl: 'SOME_URL',

    jasmineNodeOpts: {
        showColors: true,
        defaultTimeoutInterval: 30000
    }
};
```

And here is a part of my log file in Jenkins

```

The tests that fail do not include pages with a lot of jquery plugin. It is pure angular sometimes, with REST calls. But still they fail.

Is waitForAngular enough or should I care of some particular situation?
When does waitForAngular return?

What `browser.debugger` does is insert a debug statement in the control flow. This is so that you can do this:

```js
element(by.id('clickme')).click();
browser.debugger();
expect(element(by.id('output')).getText()).toEqual('hi');
```

And the test will pause after the element has been clicked but before the text is grabbed. Note that this is after the whole test has been executed and the asynchronous tasks have been queued up.

Now, this is expected to fail:

element(by.id('clickme')).click();
browser.debugger();

I guess this does not work out-of-the-box with the current codemirror editor.
2. Add the option to click the image placeholder (dropzone) and paste, this requires an extra button on the image placeholder.

The issue was closed because it required more consideration, which i agree if you choose for option 2. It is not intuitive.

My issue is based on the first suggestion, and the new textarea editor.

I haven't been party to any such plans, but you can remove `esnext` until we make a decision on Facebook Flow. It was added to our javascript style guide repo to accommodate use of `const` in ripple-rest, but we don't use it [const] in ripple-lib

The Tag Settings Menu that is activated upon navigating to the Tags section of Settings shows multiple URL input boxes and multiple submit buttons if the ""fileStorage: false"" config option is set. 

When navigating to other tags in the Tags section of Settings the total amount of URL input boxes and submit buttons increases on each tag that one navigates to. 

When navigating away from the Tags section of Settings (example: going to Users) and returning to the Tags section and navigating to the TSM for a tag the initial number of errant URL input boxes returns.
 
### Steps to Reproduce

Set the ""fileStorage: false"" setting in config.js. Enable ""tagsUI: true"" in config.js. 

Go to Ghost Admin page and navigate to Settings -> Tags. Select a tag to activate the Tag Settings Menu slide-out. See the Tag Image Field being displayed improperly as in the first attached image.

Select a different tag from the one initially selected from within the Tags section of Settings to enable the Tag Settings Menu slide-out once again. See that the number of URL fields and Submit buttons has increased as in the second attached image.

The correct behavior should be one that matches the rest of Ghost while the ""fileStorage: false"" setting is being utilized: One URL field and One Submit button.

It does not pause on the `browser.debugger();` line. Coming from Ruby on Rails, the equivalent of this would be `binding.pry`. `binding.pry` *would* pause here. It does not care if you have an exception happening after it.

This code does pause as expected:

I didn't understand what those differences were, however. Does the documentation mention the case described above?

The documentation says ```We use browser.debugger(); instead of node's debugger; statement so that the test pauses after the get command has been executed. Using debugger; pauses the test after the get command is scheduled but has not yet been sent to the browser.```, but I don't know what the `get` command is in this context or what the implications might be.

Anyway, I'm clear on why `browser.debugger()` was not pausing now.

Using `iit` or `ddescribe` would not be feasible as we would have to manually go in to around a large amount of test files to exclusively include (or exclude via `xit` or `xdescribe`).

The functionality would be like how `mocha` has a `-g` option.

I need to run some tests against an instantiated application; when the tests are done, I want to shut down the application gracefully. Before and After hooks make sense for this, right? Wrong! The application will never get cleaned up if there is an error because the after hook doesn't run!

I'm not sure why hooks are treated the same as test suites; the intent of the 'bail' option is just to stop running tests, but cleanup should still happen; that is, 'after' hooks that apply to tests that did run should be executed.",[Unconfirmed],[fad8c7],[0],[],1588419,myndzi,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-06 19:44:00,2015-01-06 20:44:13,4,2015-01-06 20:44:13,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

I'm running my tests for a hybrid app on an Android tablet. After properly configuring the server's capabilities, I kept running into a `StaleElementReferenceException`. It turns out that this is because `by.model` doesn't work with Selendroid.

An error should be provided if a locator is not supported.

**To reproduce:**
1. Have a hybrid Android app that uses Angular
2. Set up configuration 
```
seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',
capabilities: {
    browserName: 'ANDROID',
    targetPlatform: {androidVersion}, //like 'ANDROID19'
    aut: {applicationId}
},

    var wd = require('wd'),
        protractor = require('protractor'),
        wdBridge = require('wd-bridge')(protractor, wd);
    wdBridge.initFromProtractor(exports.config);
    wdBrowser.context('WEBVIEW');
},
```

When `--suite` parameter is set to 1 value `protractor.currentSuite` is easy, simple assigns to argv.suite.
When `--suite` is set to multiple values or omitted then it gets trickier because the current value of `protractor.currentSuite` depends on pattern matching the current test file name with the suites listed in the configuration.

Current API call will generate something along these lines:
`select * from posts where slug = ? and status = 'published'`

to get the next post I wanted to extend the query like this:
`select * from posts where 
(slug = ? and status = 'published') 
or id = (select min(id) from posts where published_at > (select published_at from posts where slug = ?))`

First problem: knex doesn't support subqueries with any operator other than 'in'. There is no way that I'm aware of to generate this in knex: `select min(id) from posts where published_at > (select published_at from posts where slug = ?)`. To workaround this I've used knex.raw queries which are not very optimal. Opened an issue here https://github.com/tgriesser/knex/issues/614

Second problem: bookshelf doesn't allow me to relax constraints on generated query.
`where (slug = ? and status = 'published')` is coming from properties set on the model by `Posts.forge(data)`. Tapping into query builder will only allow me to append constraints (i.e. `(slug = ? and status = 'published') AND ...`), no way to OR them.

There's clearly an easier path to the solution that I don't see yet. But I'm new to all three: knex, bookshelf & ghost, so oh well, the battle goes on.","[api, help wanted]","[FA18A8, 009800]","[0, 0]","[, ]",101513,ErisDS,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2014-10-10 07:29:02,2015-01-07 02:03:42,5,,68968604,2015-01-07 02:03:42,2015-01-07 02:03:42,COLLABORATOR,4452263,ekulabuhov,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

This PR proposes changing the behavior of --async-only so that it only fails if the function does not accept a done callback or return a promise. This makes the flag even more useful since forgetting to return a promise will now report an error when using --async-only.

at first I have to say, I like your work. It is a great tool that helps me a lot at the moment. In addition I wanted to ask, if you plan further development? There are several things to do I guess.
Of course I saw, you did not commit anything about two months now, but maybe you continued developing at home? 

e.g. what about:
- ref-attributes in element-tags
- the documentation-attibute in a complexType (it gets ignored I guess atm?)
- complexTypes in element-tags?

These are several things that do not work atm, afaik, and I wanted to ask, if you are going to fix these things, maybe?

The only real problem is that it display the request URL as a URL encoded one, but if you look at the call itself (using your browser's console, for example), it does send it as comma-separated request as expected.

This is the *default* behavior of arrays. If you want to change it, you need to add a property called `collectionFormat`. For `fields=date&fields=title&fields=description` you need to use `multi` as the value of that field.

For second example of `fields[]=date%2Ctitle%2Cdescription` is indeed comma-separated, only the name of the parameter is `fields[]` and not `fields`.

Note that I'm *not* asking to be able to attach to an already running local browser, for example that the console user has started up themselves (e.g. [Issue 18](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=18) ).

Rather, what I mean is, if I have started up a selenium browser session using, for example, a different testing framework or language bindings (e.g. python selenium ), run some tests in there, and exported the session ID into the environment or in some other way made it available, it would be nice to be able to configure protractor in the normal way (e.g. using an option in the protractor configuration file) to access this session.  Something like the below pseudo-code snippet.  It seems like this should be possible and relatively straightforward using the capabilities described here [attachToSession](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/api?view=webdriver.WebDriver.attachToSession).

In my particular use case, I'm doing some testing in Python involving creating a new user, resetting the password, logging in, &c; which in my application do not involve Angular JS.  At the end of these tests, I have a browser session on the app with a newly created, logged-in user with a randomized credentials. I'd like to proceed to test the Angular app with Protractor using the existing browser session, I can get the sessionId from the Python binding, and I can quit the python testing process without closing the browser.

I know that I could re-write all these tests to use protractor but that would be a huge pain, because I'm making use of a bunch of convenient python libraries to check email accounts for password reset emails.

I also know that i could just go ahead and close the browser, and then re-open a new session with protractor, but I pay by the minute for my remote browser service and would rather not burn the two minutes to wind-down and wind-up a new session.

```javascript
exports.config = {
    ...
    'capabilities': {
        ...
        'sessionId':'uuid-of-an-existing-selenium-session',
        // or even better . . . 
        'sessionId':process.env.SELENIUM_SESSION_ID,

I see now this is a particular Jasmine limitation and precisely why determining the current suite or current spec #587 file name implies an architectural change width the added complexity that may change with Jasmine 2.0.

The test suite is NOT empty ! Shouldn't the tests fail on timeout with one detected test ?

I'm trying to build a swagger-ui distribution on windows 7, but I have some issues with npm, cake and handlebars configuration.

I found a previous bug fix #68 but it doesn't work for me.

Has anyone already done that ?

Note: Ok, I've already created an issue about this, but I think like posting a new subject here is more appropriate.

I have a couple fixes and functionalities that I'd like to submit as pull resquests on swagger-ui but... first I need to compile swagger-ui from the source code. Until now, I've done all the work straight in javascript on the dist code... So, I back on the right track :)

step 1: npm run-script build

swagger-ui@0.1.14 build c:\workspace\swagger-ui
PATH=$PATH:./node_modules/.bin cake dist
but cake does not started.. nothing happens.
step 2 : I tried to run cake on command line : cake dist

Build distribution in ./dist
path.existsSync is now called fs.existsSync.

handlebars templates are not generated. exec command does not work properly.

step3 : I found a previous issue that seems to be related :

#68

I tried to install handlebars and cake as global node modules
still the same errors...

step5 : I tried to generate the handlebars template on command line.

ok this work, the template is correctly generated.

so I don't understand why the exec command is not working, it seems that launching handlebars from cakefile does not work on windows 7...

finally
I'm kind of stuck in the middle of the build...

Thanks for your help all.

I want to setup data for a particular test let say create a user and go to a page without requiring to carry out the login ui tasks.

To do this I need to 
1) post the new user credentials
2) take token from response
3) add token to cookies
4) Go to page for testing

How do I do a post from within a protractor test

I don't want to do this in the onPrepare as during testing I may have other data setup, so I can test the ui section in isolation.

1) We're developing against [this swagger-2 spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md). There are some holes in the docs, but our API is relatively simple, so we pulled through.

2) Swagger-ui.js: version 2.1.0-alpha.7

From project root I launch:

`node_modules/sequelize-cli/bin/sequelize model:generate --name User --attributes email:string,name:string,hash:string,salt:string`

After this I get `coffee/models/user.coffee`:

    ""use strict""
    module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) ->
      User = sequelize.define(""User"",
        email: DataTypes.STRING
        name: DataTypes.STRING
        hash: DataTypes.STRING
        salt: DataTypes.STRING
      ,
        classMethods:
          associate: (models) ->
      )
  
      # associations can be defined here
      User
      
And `coffee/migrations/20150107142601-create-user.coffee`:

    ""use strict""
    module.exports =
      up: (migration, DataTypes, done) ->
        migration.createTable(""Users"",
          id:
            allowNull: false
            autoIncrement: true
            primaryKey: true
            type: DataTypes.INTEGER

          email:
            type: DataTypes.STRING

          name:
            type: DataTypes.STRING

          hash:
            type: DataTypes.STRING

          salt:
            type: DataTypes.STRING

          createdAt:
            allowNull: false
            type: DataTypes.DATE

          updatedAt:
            allowNull: false
            type: DataTypes.DATE
        ).done done
        return

      down: (migration, DataTypes, done) ->
        migration.dropTable(""users"").done done
        return
        
Is it supposed migration file to create fields `createdAt` and `updatedAt` despite `underscored` option set to `true`? It seems migration file should contain smth like:

    created_at:
      allowNull: false
      type: DataTypes.DATE

    updated_at:
      allowNull: false
      type: DataTypes.DATE
      
and model one:

    ...
    hash: DataTypes.STRING
    salt: DataTypes.STRING
    createdAt:
      field: ""created_at""
    updatedAt:
      field: ""updated_at""
  
Is `underscored` option not yet supported in cli or I'm just doing something wrong?

I can't think of any cases where `boss` (assignments where comparisons are expected) or `W004` (redefining parameters) should be allowed, but if there is a rare case where someone really wants to use it, they can disable the jshint warning with the `// jshint ignore:line` comment directive.

`npm test` is currently failing at the jshint check. Please can you fix this and add tests to test/unit/io.js to cover your new options and code.

Please can you rename the slightly generic sounding `overlap` method to be the more-specific `tileOverlap`, which would also then match `tileSize`.

The pre-compiled libvips-dev packages for the latest stable Debian/Ubuntu releases don't include the libgsf-1-dev dependency so it's probably best to wrap the use of the `vips_dzsave` method in resize.cc with `#ifdef HAVE_GSF` (if that's available) or similar.

Are you able to update the preinstall.sh script with the new dependencies on libgsf-1-dev for Debian-based and libgsf-devel for RHEL-based Linux?

Once you're happy with the above, please can you change the destination of your PR to the `intake` branch (a limitation of Github means you may have to close and open a new PR to do this) as that's where the new features for the next major release v0.9.0 are assembling themselves. Sorry for not making the branching tactics clear - I need to improve making contribution as easy as possible.

Finally, and most importantly, please can you add yourself to the list of contributors in package,json as you deserve it.

Cheers,
Lovell

Is it supposed migration file to create fields `createdAt` and `updatedAt` despite `underscored` option set to `true`? It seems migration file should contain smth like:

    created_at:
      allowNull: false
      type: DataTypes.DATE

    updated_at:
      allowNull: false
      type: DataTypes.DATE
      
and model one:

    ...
    hash: DataTypes.STRING
    salt: DataTypes.STRING
    createdAt:
      field: ""created_at""
    updatedAt:
      field: ""updated_at""
  
Is `underscored` option not yet supported in cli or I'm just doing something wrong?

You can use one of the two ways to select an option:

```javascript
    var options = element(by.id('frequencySalary'));
    options.sendKeys('Monthly')
```

or

```javascript
    var optionsElements = element(by.id('frequencySalary')).all(by.tagName('option'));
    optionsElements.count().then(function(count) {console.log('I have ' + count + ' options')});
    optionsElements.get(1).click(); // click on 2nd option
```

It's a bad idea to test the chore browser's behavior as it's not your logic, i.e. you should not need to test that arrow keys work with options since that's something your browser implements.

When the then/success callback of the promise is executed in the control flow, it is run with the `opt_active` parameter `false`, which means that the current active frame will not be switched to the child. It ends up with a pending task for execute1 and a child task for execute2 - thus the lock.

On the other hand, if the code is just:

```js
var webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver');
var util = require('util');
var flow = webdriver.promise.controlFlow();

flow.execute(function() {
  console.log('A');
  return flow.execute(function() {
    console.log('C'); // called successfully
  }, 'execute2');
}, 'execute1');
```
then the execute2 task is scheduled in a child frame and the active frame gets switched to that frame - it finishes, the parent frame finishes, everything is happy.

Here are the annotated logs showing this difference (I used custom logging added to the webdriver node module):

Situation A: lock
```
{ history: [],
  activeFrame: '[execute1]',
  activeRoot: '[execute1]' }
--- loop turn ---
{ history: [],
  activeFrame: '[execute1]',
  activeRoot: '[execute1]' }
--- run in new frame from run event loop ---
execute1
--- start run in new frame ---
{ history: [],
  activeFrame: '[(pending - execute1)]',
  activeRoot: '[(pending - execute1)]' }
A
--- run in new frame from notify ---
--- start run in new frame ---
{ history: [],
  activeFrame: '[(pending - execute1)]',
  activeRoot: '[(pending - execute1)]' }
B
--- after run in new frame ---
{ history: [],
  activeFrame: '[(pending - execute1)[execute2]]',
  activeRoot: '[(pending - execute1)[execute2]]' }
and then that repeats forever
```

Situation B: no lock

That bit works fine.  I have tried lots of different options to then use the arrow keys to move down the list of options, none of which worked.  How do I use the arrow keys to move to an option and then select it with ENTER?

I am trying to automate the page with just keys to prove the page is accessible and also to test that it works for power users who prefer keyboard to mouse so click etc will not suffice.

To navigate the page with TABs I wrote this:

```
exports.tab = function (identifier) {
    browser.driver.actions().sendKeys(protractor.Key.TAB).perform().then(function () {
        browser.driver.switchTo().activeElement().getAttribute('id').then(function (id) {
            if (identifier === id) {
                console.log('found ' + id);
            } else {
                console.log('looking for ' + identifier);
                exports.tab(identifier);
            }
        });
    });
};
```

I was hoping to do something similar for KeyDown, keep pressing keyDown until the right value is selected.  The following code opens the drop down and then logs the html of the selected element which is the drop down.

```
exports.arrowDown = function (identifier) {
    return browser.driver.actions().sendKeys(protractor.Key.ARROW_DOWN).perform().then(function(){
        browser.driver.switchTo().activeElement().getAttribute('id').then(function (id) {
            element(by.id(id)).getOuterHtml().then(function(value){

In your case where you wrapped the ElementFinder (which is a promise) in a promise, webdriver will first resolve the outer promise. Then seeing the ElementFinder is also a promise, resolve that as well, resulting in the failure. There is no way to tell `then` to only resolve once. 

```javascript
it('error', function(){
      var el1 = element(by.xpath('//bar')); //this is a promise
      var el2 = protractor.promise.fulfilled(el1); //this is also a promise

```javascript
elementFinder.then(function(e) {
  //e should be a raw web element, and has to throw ElementNotFound.
})
```

Of course we can break this contract in a breaking change, which I am supportive of because people make lots of mistakes with this (see below for example), but that's a separate discussion. 

All in all, you should never wrap ElementFinder in a promise, because that's a recipe to failure and flakiness. Imagine this:

```javascript
var el1 = element(by.css('some_valid_css'));
var promise = protractor.promise.fulfilled(el1);
promise.then(function(elementFinder){
    elementFinder.click();
    expect(elementFinder.getText()).toEqual('some value');
});
```

Many people erroneously think the above is equivalent to:
```javascript
var el1 = element(by.css('some_valid_css'));
el1.click();
expect(el1.getText()).toEqual('some value');
```

But that's not the case because in the first snippet, `elementFinder` is actually not an element finder, but a raw webelement resolved from `el1`. The result?

I am using Windows 7 64bit with Node version `v0.10.26`.

I've narrowed this down to a  minimal test case. The config file is:
```javascript
exports.config = {

    seleniumPort: null,
    seleniumArgs: [],

    specs: [
        '../spec-e2e/**/*.spec.js'
    ],

    chromeOnly: false,

    multiCapabilities: [
        {
            'browserName': 'chrome'
        },
        {
            'browserName': 'firefox'
        },
        {
            'browserName': 'internet explorer'
        }
    ],

    suites: {
        testsuite: '../spec-e2e/roles.spec.js'
    },

    baseUrl: 'http://google.ca',
    allScriptsTimeout: 10000,

    jasmineNodeOpts: {
        onComplete: null,
        isVerbose: false,
        showColors: true,
        includeStackTrace: true
    }
};
```
The only spec (the roles spec specified above) is simply:
```javascript
describe('Settings-Administration-Roles', function() {
    it('is dependent on the Users page for user/membership addition', function() {
        expect(1).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    });
});
```
Now, this _doesn't_ happen every time that Protractor is run: only about every 3-10 times or so. Thus, I built a script for reproducing this:
```batch
@echo off
set /a index=0
setlocal ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION
:start
	set /a index=index+1
	call node_modules\.bin\protractor config\spec-e2e.js --suite testsuite >> StrangeErrorTest%index%.txt
goto start
```

One of the failed logs looks like:

After doing so, my profile picture in my Ghost blog began to appear as a broken image. 

![screen shot 2015-01-07 at 11 07 22 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3655670/5657748/fd824c40-96c1-11e4-9e94-f18b4d24400a.png)

**Issue**
If a user is using their Gravatar for a profile image and they switch the image to one with a rating greater than ""G"", their profile image in Ghost will now be a broken image.

**Steps to reproduce**
* Create a new user account using an email address that has a Gravatar associated with it (rating of ""G"")
* Visit http://www.gravatar.com and change your Gravatar rating to ""PG""
* Visit your Ghost blog and look anywhere the profile picture should appear (login as the user, etc)

**Separate note**
If you attempt to create a user account and your Gravatar is already rated above ""G"", no profile picture is set (because the current implementation returns a 404 for anything above ""G"").

**Suggestions on a fix?**
I've found where the issue occurs, but need some guidance as to how to proceed with a fix.

I could make a simple change to increase the acceptable rating for Gravatars (to which level would be up for discussion), or just fix the broken images when a user happens to switch to a Gravatar that is not rated ""G"".

The very first thing I tried to do was require ghost and pass it configuration options collected from the rest of my app. 

It wouldn't be much of an mess to take options at start up. The problem looks to stem from [here](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/config/index.js#L404). The config handler exports a singleton and it will only read from a hard coded path for testing. 

This could be made pretty flexible with out a lot of code with something like [nconf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nconf) or [confit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/confit). 

This would make multi-tier config pretty straight forward and make ghost as a module really simple to set up and run.

This is how we [use nconf in our production apps](https://gist.github.com/esatterwhite/14e4361d0d49865ce3d2) 

minus all of the documentation in there, this is less than 100 lines of code.

This conf module checks for:
1. System level overrides
2. Command line arguments
3. Environment variables
4. A configuration file(s)
5. System specified defaults

This could easily be extended to key off of NODE_ENV and read config.<ENV>.json, etc if that is your cup of tea. And this would really be a matter of changing `config.foo` to `+config.get('foo')`

Doing something like this would free developers to set up, deploy and configure ghost how ever they wanted. It would also mean that I don't have to keep massive config files with sensitive authentication information in source control.",[],[],[],[],123503,coen-hyde,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2014-12-29 20:23:06,2015-01-08 04:16:53,4,,69133882,2015-01-08 04:16:53,2015-01-08 04:16:53,COLLABORATOR,148561,esatterwhite,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

                }
              };
            });

    executing commands with space

    var command = java -jar xxx.jar xxxuser xxxpass;

It is not executing as expected, browser and protractor are stuck.

By manual (the same way need to execute via script)

java -jar xxx.jar
enter username: xxxuser
enter password: xxxpass

Problem seems jar file take some time to execute, but all other commands are executed before the execution of Jar file

Thanks in advance, help me to solve this issue

Firstly, I think that Ghost showing a broken image is a bug that ought to be fixed - I am sure there are other reasons why we might get into this state other than the rating (internet problems, gravatar service problems etc) but whilst we have a pretty straightforward reproduction case, it would be great to fix it so that it always falls back to the default if at all possible.

Secondly, I don't think Ghost needs to have any opinion what-so-ever on someone's profile picture. Therefore I think we can also increase the acceptable rating so that it doesn't matter what rating the picture is. If you do signup not realising Ghost will pull your gravatar and want to remove it, that's easy to do.

My assumption is that if there are 0 elements, then the locator didn't work at all, in which case there is no list and a get() will fail regardless of the index. If I understand you correctly, the advantage of the current error message is that it indicates the usage of element.all() instead of just element()?

I don't feel like information about the locator is totally necessary if you're trying to access index 5 of an element array with only 4 elements--in that case, the error makes total sense, and the locator is probably fine.

It does occur to me that maybe someone would use element.all with a program flow that determines what to do next based on if the resulting array is empty or not, and loops for each element in the array.

The way I understand it, dealing with the broken/404 image result is really easy to handle.  There's a `d` (for default) query parameter that takes a few options.  Right now we have it set to return `404` if the Gravatar isn't available.  If it's set to `mm` it will return the ""silhouette"" image--that's probably what we should be going with.

may i request changing the compression type for JSZip from default 'STORE' to 'DEFLATE'?  or alternatively, adding the abiility to pass in a config object for JSZip file() method, or a flag to switch compression types?

example:
```javascript:
xlsx.file(""[Content_Types].xml"",Content_TypesXML.end(xmlOutVars), {compression: 'DEFLATE'});
xlsx.file(""[Content_Types].xml"",Content_TypesXML.end(xmlOutVars), this.jszipOpts);

I too had the same problem and i solved it by setting a timeout, you can read a description for that in this post,
http://captaindanko.blogspot.com.au/2015/01/capturing-screenshot-of-page-from-your.html

That post also contains snippets of the sort of code that I had written for it.

Now what I could not fully understand is, why did i need to use a timeout to make it work on Firefox? So I do not have an outstanding issue or anything. I just wanted to understand why the timeout should be used. All I have are educated guesses as to why I might need to use it, but not a solid understanding that I can back it up with facts.

* don't use require() - this isn't node, so it won't be available
* `turf` is available as a library by default
* use `//=` comments to expose things

so for example:

```js
var points = turf.featurecollection([
  turf.point(10.1953125, 43.75522505306928),
  turf.point(10.404052734375, 43.84245116699039),
  turf.point(10.579833984375, 43.6599240747891),
  turf.point(10.360107421875, 43.51668853502909),
  turf.point(10.140380859375, 43.58834891179792),
  turf.point(10.1953125, 43.75522505306928)]);

var result = turf.featurecollection(
  points.features.concat([turf.convex(points)]));
//=result
```

The line `//=result` is like saying 'make a map with what's in the variable `result` right now'.

* I've been using `turf.featurecollection` a bunch to show before & after on the same map, but you can also do multiple maps by using `//=` comments twice or more
* esprima seems to prefer semicolons.

Buffers are circles... but geojson only really represents polygons as lists of edges. This means that a ""perfect"" circle is not actually possible. This is a problem related to the [coastline paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox). In a nutshell, a circle has an infinite number of vertices if defined as a polygon, so you have to decide on a resolution for your vertices. This is currently fixed in turf-buffer, and it is unaffected by the size of the buffer. 

Also note that Leaflet does some automatic simplification of its own, so the display may be more jagged when zoomed out, even if the data you are using for calculations is more precise.

There is a branch of turf-buffer I will be pushing out in a couple days that will give you perfectly circular point buffers, as well as an optional curve resolution. This means you can specify whatever detail you would like (memory and performance *will* be affected, but you can tinker with it).

It needs a bigger update, as all themes should have their own table syntax (eg. bootstrap classes) or must fit some CSS to our syntax, but it worth it. It's a commonly used feature.

When importing data from a Ghost installation (Blog Old) to a different install of Ghost (Blog New) and then logging out of the Blog New admin account on Blog New a user attempting to log back in to Blog New with the (different) account details for the imported ""Owner"" account from Blog Old is given an error message saying that the account is ""Locked due to too many login attempts."", urging them to use the Forgotten Password link, even though this account has never attempted a log in before on this new installation of Ghost.

### Steps to Reproduce

Export Ghost settings and data from one Ghost install, import into a different installation.

Log out of Ghost on the installation which the data was imported into.

Attempt log in with account credentials contained in imported data and settings, see incorrect error message.

### Expected behavior 

User is given correct error message explaining why they are unable to log in. Or, user is able to log in to imported accounts without any issues when importing from another Ghost installation.

These servers are behind a NAT, and there's an Elastic Load Balancer which directs traffic in round-robin fashion to distribute load among the servers.

When there's a Facebook authentication, the callback response may go to the same server that issued the request, but sometimes it goes to the wrong server (because browsing traffic can be directed to any webserver in the stack).  So if we reduce the number of webservers to 1, everything works great.  If we increase the number of webservers and increase traffic, the client hangs waiting for the callback.

I'm looking for a best-practice way of addressing this use case.

After doing so, my profile picture in my Ghost blog began to appear as a broken image. 

![screen shot 2015-01-07 at 11 07 22 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3655670/5657748/fd824c40-96c1-11e4-9e94-f18b4d24400a.png)

**Issue**
If a user is using their Gravatar for a profile image and they switch the image to one with a rating greater than ""G"", their profile image in Ghost will now be a broken image.

**Steps to reproduce**
* Create a new user account using an email address that has a Gravatar associated with it (rating of ""G"")
* Visit http://www.gravatar.com and change your Gravatar rating to ""PG""
* Visit your Ghost blog and look anywhere the profile picture should appear (login as the user, etc)

**Separate note**
If you attempt to create a user account and your Gravatar is already rated above ""G"", no profile picture is set (because the current implementation returns a 404 for anything above ""G"").

**Suggestions on a fix?**
I've found where the issue occurs, but need some guidance as to how to proceed with a fix.

I could make a simple change to increase the acceptable rating for Gravatars (to which level would be up for discussion), or just fix the broken images when a user happens to switch to a Gravatar that is not rated ""G"".

When the `basePath` ends with a slash, and the API resource `path` starts with a slash, a URL with a double slash is produced.

```js
// GET /explorer/resources/products

{ 
  apiVersion: '1.6.3',
  swaggerVersion: '1.2',
  basePath: 'http://127.0.0.1:62232/',

  apis: [ { path: '/products', operations: { /* ... */ } },
  // etc.

----

We now have zip support in the uploader, meaning that it is possible to import from a set of files, rather than a single file. This issue describes the basic markdown file support that should be built into the importer in order to handle Roon imports. There are likely more features that could/should be added (like handling frontmatter), and it is also likely that the importer will get restructured to be an app or series of apps in future.

When importing markdown files the following rules apply:

- If a single markdown file is imported, this should become a post
- If multiple markdown files are imported via a zip, each one should become a zip.

The content of the markdown file is handled as follows:

- If it has a level one heading marked up with `# My Heading`, this should be treated as the post's title (i.e. `post.title`) and removed from the content
- If it has an image with no alt before a level one heading, this should be treated as a featured image (i.e. `post.image`) and removed from the content
- The remaining content of the markdown file should become the content for the post (i.e. `post.markdown`)

The filename is handled as follows:

- If it contains a status (published or draft) then this status should be used for the post and the status should be removed from the filename \*
- If it contains a date or date and time, then this should be used as the created_at date for drafts, or the published_at date for published posts and removed from the filename
- The remaining filename should be used as the slug
- If there is no title in the markdown, the slug should be used as the title as-is

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a post with the tag 'Produce' (or any other tag which can be a substring of another tag) and publish it 
2. Create a post with the tag 'Reproduce' (or any other tag which is a superstring of the first tag) and publish it 
3. Update your theme to check for the superstring tag, something like `{{#has tag=""reproduce""}}Hello World{{/has}}`
4. Check your blog and see that both posts output 'Hello World' not just the post with 'reproduce' as a tag.

Tag matches should be exact.

Special characters in post URLs such as `.` are replaced with a dash. This is also nice because the period often separates words and the dash keeps the URL readable.

__Problem:__

I've noticed that the `@` is removed instead of replaced with a dash. If this was intentional, then you can go ahead and close this issue:)

However, for myself, this often results in URLs that jumble words. For example:

-  `phonegap-cli@4.1.2` --> `/phonegap-cli4-1-2`
- `PhoneGap Meetup@Vancouver` --> `/phonegap-meetupvancouver`

It would be nice to replace the `@` with a `-` so the URLs are generated as:

-  `phonegap-cli@4.1.2` --> `/phonegap-cli-4-1-2`
- `PhoneGap Meetup@Vancouver` --> `/phonegap-meetup-vancouver`

Since `runFilenameOrFn_()` already supports the concept of passing arguments to the callback, this only requires a 1-line code change.

This is completely fine for me, but I was just confused about the branching scheme as master and v2 are basically the same thing, and we do not intend to break backwards compat in master in the near future.

What we are doing in Jade is basically everything happens in master, and once design flaws and old bugs (whose fixes would break backward compat) pile up, we branch out to a new branch, and concurrent development happens with v2 routinely merged from master. When v2 is mature enough (and when we have too many fixes piled up) we merge from it.

Considering the fact that we are not like the Linux kernel or huge projects with multiple supported release branches, I feel that the Jade system works pretty well; but if you prefer to *always* have a production branch, go ahead, I don't hold a strong opinion.",[],[],[],[],1538624,TimothyGu,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-10 04:32:15,2015-01-10 06:16:57,2,,69445224,2015-01-10 06:16:57,2015-01-10 06:16:57,COLLABORATOR,1538624,TimothyGu,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

1. Either the users object returned is a promise causing the above error // We'll catch this by console logging the user object

While default values can accomplish the same goal to some extent, it's convenient to be able to share many different parameters for the same operation.

So for the pet store example, I might want to point a developer to a particularly interesting pet, or help them create a default pet in their account to start them off (though this feature only really makes sense on a more complex API).

Example: this will open the `pet/getPetById` operation and pre-fill the `petId` field with the value `4`
`http://localhost:3000/#!/pet/getPetById?petId=4`

Example: this will open the `pet/addPet` operation and pre-fill the `body` field with the value `{""id"":4, ""name"":""Spike""}` so the developer only has to click the ""Try it out!"" button to create their first pet.
`http://localhost:3000/#!/pet/addPet?body=%7B%22id%22%3A4%2C+%22name%22%3A%22Spike%22%7D&parameterContentType=application%2Fjson`

The characters are: 
- punctuation: `'`, `""`  `:`  `,` `;` `?` and `!` `'`, `""`
- and-like things: `&` `+` and `|`
- at `@`
- slashes: `/` and `\`
- brackets `[` `]` `(` `)` `<` and `>`
- other symbols `$` `£` `#` `%`  `*`  `=`  `^`  and `~`  

The issue is, as I see it, where symbols are used to separate words without spaces. Usually, there would be spaces as well as the symbol, and the spaces would end up being collapsed down into a single dash. 

So the question becomes what symbols, like the `@` sign, are likely to be used without spaces as word separators, as opposed to being used as prefixes and suffixes that don't require the concept of a space.

I think the answer to this is anything and-like for sure and probably a lot of the punctuation (colons and commas).

However, from another perspective, we do already collapse down multiple dashes, so if there is more than one dash that's ok. The main thing that I don't think we do currently, is trim away a leading or trailing dash.

If we de-duplicate and trim away leading/trailing dashes, then we can probably replace most characters with a dash, rather than removing it and the question becomes which characters can't we do that for - to which the answer is  'any character which could appear in the middle of a word' - i.e basically just `'`

Or did I just massively over-simplify this?

Tests and real-world use cases would be helpful I think :)

It's also worth taking a look at this PR: https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/4292 and its related issue as this was attempted before (adding a retire grunt task) and it didn't work out.

Basically, I think that a good solution would work with all of Ember data's ajax requests, not just the post autosave.

When you create a new post, the latest post appears at the bottom of the post list until refreshing, or leaving then revisiting the admin interface.

![new_post_issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3655670/5693745/4eeff4b2-98fa-11e4-98e6-a08a4fea4f21.gif)


### Steps to Reproduce

1. Login to Ghost, note the order of the posts.
2. Create a new post, and publish it.
3. Return to the ""Content"" menu and note the new post appears at the bottom of the list.

This is a bug because the default ordering of the post list is reverse chronological order, thus the latest post should appear at the top of the list.

These aren't ""internal"" variables - they came FROM the very same config that onPrepare() is being executed in. It's not passing `this` (which has driverprovider and all sorts of things)... just `config`:

```javascript
var Runner = function(config) {    /// <------ I give you the config in the first place...
  log.set(config);
  this.preparer_ = null;
  this.driverprovider_ = null;
  this.config_ = config;                   /// <----- You're just giving it back as a convenience...
  // ...
};
```

The only vars in that block that don't come from the caller are:

```javascript
     // The CURRENT capabilities being run
    capabilities: {},
    // The command used to start Protractor
    '$0': 'node ./node_modules/protractor/bin/protractor',
    // An array of args used to start Protractor
    _: [ 'test-client/protractor.conf.js' ],
    // ... There may be an additional var or two depending on how the Selenium config was interpreted
```

I would still argue that these additional vars are useful. onPrepare()'s purpose is very well aligned with the need for these variables. To do anything context-sensitive when you aren't using `multiCapabilities` you need to take an internal reference to your own config object before you export it. It's just a sensible convenience to pass it back for that case. That's especially valuable when onPrepare is an external script - a nice feature added recently but it's super awkward to pass config data to it...

Finally, I would argue that multiple configs is a terrible answer. This whole `multiCapabilities` feature must have been added for a reason, but there are half a dozen issues posted over the last year asking how to do things with it where the answer was ""sorry, you can't, use multiple configs"".

That change changes the way items in the content list are rendered from being what I assume is the proxied items  in the `ArrayController` that is the PostController:

`{{#each itemController=""posts/post"" itemView=""post-item-view"" itemTagName=""li""}}`

To explicitly grabbing posts from the model: 

`{{#each post in model itemController=""posts/post"" itemView=""post-item-view"" itemTagName=""li""}}`

But the documentation for Ember SortableMixin, which provides the ability to sort items in an ArrayController, says this:

> Ember.SortableMixin provides a standard interface for array proxies to specify a sort order and maintain this sorting when objects are added, removed, or updated without changing the implicit order of their underlying model array

So as I understand it, the model itself is not sorted. Ember adds the new post at the end, and it works when you refresh because then the items are provided from the server in the right order.

*(I'm typing this out because I'm trying to improve my understanding of the Ember internals and perhaps someone can point out mistakes in my understanding or terminology that will help me in future)*

I've done a bit of reading and it seems SortableMixin is supposed to be being deprecated, and I also believe Ember is moving away from using ObjectController and ArrayController where the model gets proxied, in order to reduce a little bit of the 'magic' and our dependence on the magic in Ghost is also what is causing #4766. 

I've read a couple of references to Ember.computed.sort, but I'm not sure how to apply it in this case. I *think* the right answer is to have a more explicit sorted version of the posts? Something like:

I am playing with `Ember.computed.sort` and I think it might be the right way to go in order to make resolving #2640 easier as well (although it would be good to get @LevelbossMike to confirm as he has the most experience with the filtering concept).

The original reason for requiring this [massive amount of ugly extra sorting code](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/client/controllers/posts.js#L40) was that the 'sortProperties' for SortableMixin all had to be in the same direction, and our post list is sorted with status:asc, and all the other properties as desc. This prevents us having to do a big union query to get drafts and published posts in the right order, but one day we'll need to do that anyway.

It seems that `Ember.computed.sort` takes a list of properties and directions, which at first look seems to mean we can remove the orderBy function completely and replace it with:

```
 sortProperties: ['status:asc', 'published_at:desc', 'updated_at:desc', 'id:desc'],
 sortedPosts: Ember.computed.sort('model', 'sortProperties'),
```

And change the template to `{{#each post in sortedPosts}}`

If it doesn't work we can replace sortProperties with our custom orderBy function again. Further when thinking about #2640, we can dynamically update sortProperties, or again use a custom function and it should be a logical extension to this change.

 I'm currently taking it for a spin to see if the order stays correct without needing all that code.","[blocker, bug]","[111111, EB2C00]","[0, 0]","[, ]",3655670,Trendy,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-11 00:00:21,2015-01-11 16:05:49,6,,69499443,2015-01-11 16:05:49,2015-01-11 16:05:49,COLLABORATOR,101513,ErisDS,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

When you create a new post, the latest post appears at the bottom of the post list until refreshing, or leaving then revisiting the admin interface.

![new_post_issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3655670/5693745/4eeff4b2-98fa-11e4-98e6-a08a4fea4f21.gif)


### Steps to Reproduce

1. Login to Ghost, note the order of the posts.
2. Create a new post, and publish it.
3. Return to the ""Content"" menu and note the new post appears at the bottom of the list.

This is a bug because the default ordering of the post list is reverse chronological order, thus the latest post should appear at the top of the list.

### Technical details

* Ghost Version: 0.5.7
* Client OS: Mac OS X 10.10.1
* Server OS: Mac OS X 10.10.1 & Ubuntu Linux 14.04
* Node Version: 0.10.30
* Browser: Chrome 39.0.2171.95 (64-bit)
* Database: SQLite

## Additional Information

I'm really new to Ember, so please feel free to call me on my ignorance, but I thought this was relevant. It seems that when the new post is added to the store (loosely assuming it has something to do with Ember Data), it is just stored as the last item until we do a completely new request to the server (refresh).

@dougwilson, I was suggesting Express could handle the mixing-in part if needed at its level, the way that EJS currently does -- if it detects a single object, takes the empty options object created by default and copies any option keys in the data object over to it. This allows people consuming the Express `render` API to use either method signature for a version, but your code underneath it to always expect separate data and options. Then once there's enough code around using the new API, you can remove the shim in a future version.

And I'm not sure what API you're thinking of for passing the locals vs. opts, but some of the changes I wanted to make here were driven by the idea of making this implementation conform more to the usual API for EJS (given that there are other implementations that have been around for a long time), and for similar template languages like ERB. I'm a fan of the Principle of Least Surprise, and letting people transfer as much knowledge from one similar area to the other.

This is a long-winded way of saying that having a ""locals"" key for the local vars subsumed in an options object is different from the way all similar systems behave, which is why I went with a (data, opts) signature. There are lots of people using EJS outside Express, and it should be the same API no matter where you go. I hope that makes sense.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a post with the tag 'Produce' (or any other tag which can be a substring of another tag) and publish it 
2. Create a post with the tag 'Reproduce' (or any other tag which is a superstring of the first tag) and publish it 
3. Update your theme to check for the superstring tag, something like `{{#has tag=""reproduce""}}Hello World{{/has}}`
4. Check your blog and see that both posts output 'Hello World' not just the post with 'reproduce' as a tag.

Tag matches should be exact.

I tried it out, the problem is not fixed in 2.0.48.

If I understand the implementation in swagger-js correctly, the code handling double-slash in the URL is inside the method `this.getAbsoluteBasePath`, which is unfortunately not invoked when the basePath is already a full URL. See [swagger.js#L451](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/blob/1f8984acebe76d055d5304420a5dfe38f9af4556/lib/swagger.js#L451):

```js
this.basePath = response.basePath.indexOf('http') === -1 ? 
  this.getAbsoluteBasePath(response.basePath) :

Later, when the user clicks on the ""Try it out!"" button, the method `urlify` performs a simple concatenation to build the URL and thus a double-slash is produced. see [swagger.js#988](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/blob/1f8984acebe76d055d5304420a5dfe38f9af4556/lib/swagger.js#L988):

We're also a bit stuck without a way to [migrate permissions](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/3910). If you follow along with [meetings / or write-ups](http://dev.ghost.org/tag/meetings/) you'll see we're planning to shift the team's focus from user-facing features as things are at the moment, towards the developer-facing features like this once we've shipped a few more of the features we're working on. 

In short, you can help us out in a number of ways, contributing in any way to the project (testing pull requests, fixing bugs and smaller issues) helps us move faster and get to this stuff sooner ;)

### Issue Summary

Unable to load next batch of posts in the posts list inside admin, when browser is larger than the initial 15 items.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Make sure there's more than 15 posts in the list. I tested with 20. It doesn't matter if they're all draft.
2. Resize your browser to a window height greater than 1500px
3. Go to [http://localhost:2368/ghost](http://localhost:2368/ghost) to see the posts list 
3. Try to scroll the posts list

When trying to scroll the posts list, nothing happens.
I would expect the list to load the next batch of posts into the list.

A workaround is to resize the browser windows for vertical scroll to appear, and then scroll the list again to load up the next batch of posts.

  See how the rotation is all messed up?  Now, let's say you link to the
original image in your post instead of downloading and uploading to your
server.  Go ahead - try it.  It works OK.  Sorry, not a browser issue, it's
something on the backend of Ghost.  I like Ghost, I really do.  Still you
guys charge a premium price for a product that isn't complete yet.

Regarding pricing, last week on blog.ghost.org they defended their hosting/pricing model.  Good for them, but I think they are asking too much for me to support a system that requires a lot of work and effort on my part. It's not a turnkey solution.

I tend to group Ghost with the hosting. I want to support the project financially because I want to see it succeed - given all the options for blogging out here it really is my favorite.

I do find the pricing model high for small users like myself.  Currently I'm using asmallorange.com for $50/year.  It seems like Ghost is losing business and revenue by pricing their stuff too high (yes, I read your recent blog article).

Keep up the hard work - I do wish you much success. I was just venting because of the frustration and extra steps I have to take with my images now. I've found a solution using an EXIF removal tool. It's just an extra step to posting that I wasn't expecting.

On the other hand, it has significant costs, as does anything that complicates the config. The idea of multiCapabilities is that you want to run the _same setup_ on a couple different browsers. We don't want, and cannot support, one config file being able to support all cases. If what you're requesting is easy to do with multiple config files, that's a great solution!

For this specific request - you can get at the current capabilities using `browser.getCapabilities` (returns a promise). Could you let us know if this doesn't cover your use case? If so, what other context are you looking for?

If we do introduce a way to get the config (which is not out of the question), I'd like it to be more general than being passed as a parameter to onPrepare functions.",[cla: yes],[c7def8],[0],[],1675563,crrobinson14,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-10 03:35:32,2015-01-12 23:47:55,6,,69670204,2015-01-12 23:47:55,2015-01-12 23:47:55,COLLABORATOR,2081709,juliemr,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

I often get ""Index out of bound"" errors, explaining that there are 0 elements in an ""element.all"" array, when a more correct/consistent error would be ""No element found using locator [Locator]"". This is a quick fix. I may have a mis-scoped object or two in my ""throw"" statement. If so, I'd appreciate a push in the right direction.

a)  make this.variables into an array for tracking states, and pop/push when save/restore is run.
b)  tap into native tracking of variables—e.g.: ""if (this.ctx[property] !== value) {"" instead of ""if (this.variables[property] !== value) {""

I think option (b) would be easier, and you don't have to worry about things as much. I did a jsperf on the performance gains of using this.variables, and it's negligible on 1,000,000 checks.

This will fix issues with shadow not rendering properly in certain cases, such as this:

First, it's not one-browser-many-cases. It's one-case-many-browsers. But browser.getCapabilities() doesn't address it because it returns Selenium's block, not Protractor's. Suppose you wanted to use a configuration similar to the one discussed in this issue:

https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/1354

Suppose you wanted your screenshot tool at the end of each test to drop the file in a directory whose name contained the resolution being captured. There's no way to do this currently - browser.getCapabilities will give you the browser name and version back, but not the other options. But with a single additional option in the capabilities block you could pass a parameter to each test that was specific to that block. This makes it a single line of code to marry these up.

Over the past year it seems like this kind of thing has been repeatedly requested:

https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/1594
(""I would definitely benefit from this..."")

https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/1195
``var capsPromise = browser.getCapabilities(); //does not contain useful stuff```

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22305297/run-protractor-tests-with-different-window-sizes

etc. Various requests to be able to pass in dynamic elements to a test like user/pass, test data, browser resolutions, etc. are all over StackOverflow and here.

config.params is messy because it's hard-coded. onPrepare is given as the specific answer for how to do things like set resolution in a number of places as well, e.g. here:

http://ramonvictor.github.io/protractor/slides/#/34

I'm not saying Ramon is the de-facto source for this information... but there certainly isn't anything to contradict it elsewhere...

Multiple configs is a bad answer because 95% of my protractor config is identical between each test - it's only the elements in each capabilities block that changes. (It's the same app... just across a range of browsers and resolutions...) Having to duplicate 200 lines of configuration data just to change ONE line of ""put THESE screen shots in THIS folder"" is a huge maintenance hassle.

Finally, it's disheartening because this was the first in a collection of contributions I had planned to make. I thought it was perfectly in line with a testing framework designed specifically for a JS framework that values declarative definitions, dependency injection, DRYness, etc. Discovering that the TESTING framework prefers basically the opposite - inferential connections between items, significant repetition, and call-for rather than injecting dependencies makes me wonder if the rest of what I had planned to suggest was misguided.

Is there a document somewhere that outlines the design principles behind this project? I have what I believe are some valuable ideas, but I don't want to be a nuisance... and I certainly don't want to repeatedly trigger 8-hour discussion about 8-byte code changes! :) I'm happy to comply with whatever those principles are... but where can I find them outlined?",[cla: yes],[c7def8],[0],[],1675563,crrobinson14,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-10 03:35:32,2015-01-13 04:05:57,7,,69692692,2015-01-13 04:05:57,2015-01-13 04:05:57,COLLABORATOR,1675563,crrobinson14,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

We just want to carefully consider the complexity of changes, guard against making breaking changes in the future, and make sure that PRs solve real use cases. There is no doc with design principles specifically laid out. This change is small in bytes, but conceptually it's a big problem ('what information should the test be able to use about the configuration'). I think that you bring up some legitimate concerns - let's work together to find a good solution. 

FYI re multiple configs: Since configs are node objects, you can create a base config and `require` it to share code. This is what the angular.js project does.

@hankduan what do you think about adding a `browser.getProcessedConfig` (name could be better) function in `Runner.prototype.createBrowser`?

The navigation menu lives on its own settings screen under `/settings/navigation/`. It uses the compass icon added in #4536. To start with, this UI should be built behind a config flag, the same as permalinks, tag management etc.

The navigation UI should start out with one default entry - ""Home"" - pointing at `{{@blog.url}}`, and with one empty entry below it with placeholder text (this will be loaded from the default setting).

### Notes on the interface:

* Ignore the application frame in the screenshot - that's just old mockup - focus on settings pane content
* Cursor state for drag handles should be ""move"" - there should be no other hover state for drag handles.
* There should be no special highlight or state when a nav-item is being dragged
* Hover state for the trash icon should be `$red`
* Add icon is the exact same one from the content screen
* Grab handles and trash icons should have padding around them for increased hit area
* There will be no concept (for this first version) of nesting / hierarchy

The API might look something like:
```javascript
var image1 = sharp('image1.jpg');
var image2 = sharp('image2.png');
image1
  .overlayWith(image2, top, left)
  .toBuffer(function(err, data) {
    ...
  });
```
In this example `data` would be in JPEG format as you're operating on `image1`. The `top` and `left` parameters could be made optional, where not providing them results in the images being centred.

Does this make sense?

Another problem is that I can't think of a way to describe multiple file uploads, unless we modify the 2.0 spec.

You can describe a single file parameter, no problem. But you cannot specify an array of files, since `file` is not an applicable value for `item`'s `type` - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#itemsType.

We could change that, though it'll carry complications to both the documentation and the schema (not a reason not to add support for it).

Even if we do add support for it, we may need to impose a `collectionFormat` value of `multi`. It makes sense for `multipart/form-data` but possibly a bit less for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (though we can infer the meaning). We can say that the `collectionFormat` is inferred and with that combination it is assumed to be `multi` (and cannot be overridden - validation error), but we have a similar case in the spec where we currently force people to include a property with a known default value which cannot be changed.

Last thing, there's a ticket for a future version of the spec to allow specifying the mime type(s) of the uploaded files, and it should integrate well into this solution.",[],[],[],[],249413,fehguy,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-13 06:26:04,2015-01-13 09:46:57,1,,69719326,2015-01-13 09:46:57,2015-01-13 09:46:57,COLLABORATOR,241629,webron,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

All of these updates have been pushed to the Live demo @ http://editordemo.ghost.io (email: demo@ghost.org, pass: test1234).

There are definitely other improvements to be had: finding a solution for tabs, cleaning up some of the upload events and other things, but the base functionality is here and I think, providing we're happy this is working nicely cross-browser, it would be preferable to get this merged into master ahead of the next release and make any further adjustments as separate PRs.

@PaulAdamDavis rebasing had a lot of conflicts in CSS - it might be worth you going through and checking that I didn't screw it up (I probably did).

Yes, @hankduan, that's roughly the goal, although I'm trying to be a little generic with my description because running multi-resolution tests is just one use-case. I can think of dozens of others when you get into enterprise-app space.

My position is that onPrepare is perfectly time for doing test-run-specific setup - that could mean configuring the browser's resolution, setting up some environment variables such as where some test outputs will be dropped, setting up a timing analytic, etc. These are things that are not ideally done before starting Protractor itself (e.g. environment variables) because of the added value of multiCapabilities. m/c is perfect for setting up a collection of browser combinations that you want to test against. Using Chrome + Firefox and adding Safari later or IE on a box that supports it is the obvious fit there, and it's the one the documents suggest.

But as soon as you say ""oh, I can say I want BOTH Firefox and Chrome"" the logical next step is to say ""Chrome 1400x1050 and also Chrome 1024x768"". This is a single line of code in onPrepare... as long as you know that this is the resolution desired. But resolution is not the only use-case - as I said above perhaps you could be testing i18n functionality and setting the browser's language. You can do that with the --lang=LANG flag in Chrome's arguments in the capabilities - but how do you tell your test to go to LANG.mydomain.com and that you want your test reports dumped out to build/reports/LANG? Yes, multiple configs are possible - but they're almost identical so it's a pain to maintain if you decide to switch to SauceLabs one day. On the other hand, a 1-line-of-code solution is possible if you make the 'current' capabilities config accessible somewhere onPrepare (and others?) can get to it. You just `browser.get('http://' + currentCapabilityConfig.lang + '.mydomain.com/');` in your test script, or `browser.takeScreenshot().then(....   // Write the PNG to 'build/screens/' + currentCapabilityConfig.lang + '/home-page.png')`

I also still think this would be very valuable when you start using Protractor's recently-added support for making these hooks call external scripts. You could have some very elegant and powerful configurations with very little work.

I could probably imagine several dozen cases where you might want to test some browser-specific aspect of your site/app, something whose only functional difference is a slight change in the capabilities config block.

I suppose the generic feature-request is to provide some way of enabling context-sensitive work to be performed inside hooks (and test scripts?) And I believe the single thing required to make all that happen is to have access to the current capability configuration object being executed. If you prefer not to inject it, perhaps a simple call to obtain it? IMO it's a little weird because there's already browser.getCapabilities() which suggests that it does this (but returns something else), but anything in this category would totally solve the problem for me.

Just brainstorming here... This may be just a horrific idea (I blame a sleepless night) but it seems like Angular's own dependency injection is a clean way to address a lot of these kinds of things. The provider/injector concept is already very familiar to Angular authors, and it seems like it wouldn't be much more than an else case and an array iterator (with calls to providers to obtain the things to inject) in the spot where hooks are being called. Totally understand if you hate the idea, but it does seem like another way to address this kind of problem in a relatively generic way that doesn't lead to hard-coding of hook arguments - and potentially even allows test authors/maintainers to create their own providers...

So it looks like not really a ""problem"", just need someone to save the log/result into a well formatted json file, which can be easily put into CI to generate beautiful  reports.

And Protractor is exact the one who already implemented ""resultJsonOutputFile"" configuration and functionality. If the Json output file is already there, why not improve it to be more CI friendly?

However we are not sure why jasmine/mocha/cucumber these three framework in Protractor need to be shared as common output. Using different testing framework to test against one project looks like not really common cases. Maybe there are some reasons for this?

With the Json format being improved, we don't need report generator like jasmine-reporters which require developers to pay attention to the configuration and match the correct reporter versions.

I upgrade the ghost from 0.3.3 to 0.5.8 according the document given by http://support.ghost.org/how-to-upgrade/
1.Download the latest version of Ghost from Ghost.org
2.Extract the zip file to a temporary location
3.Delete existing index.js and package.json then copy new index.js and package.json files to the same directory.
4.Next, delete the old core directory completely, and then put the new core directory in its place.
5.For releases which include update to Casper (the default theme), delete the old content/themes/casper directory and put the new one its place
6.Run npm install --production
7.Finally, Restart Ghost so that the changes take effect

Then, when i use ""npm start"" to start my ghost, there is an error happen, here is log:

ghost@0.5.8 start /home/xiaohuolu/blog

I upgrade the ghost from 0.3.3 to 0.5.8 according the document given by http://support.ghost.org/how-to-upgrade/
1.Download the latest version of Ghost from Ghost.org
2.Extract the zip file to a temporary location
3.Delete existing index.js and package.json then copy new index.js and package.json files to the same directory.
4.Next, delete the old core directory completely, and then put the new core directory in its place.
5.For releases which include update to Casper (the default theme), delete the old content/themes/casper directory and put the new one its place
6.Run npm install --production
7.Finally, Restart Ghost so that the changes take effect

Then, when i use ""npm start"" to start my ghost, there is an error happen, here is log:

ghost@0.5.8 start /home/xiaohuolu/blog

This results in easier learning curve, faster feature delivery and easier maintainability.

For example, we use this to write tests to test protractor -- i.e. asserting stacktrace is sane, error code is correct, right errors are being thrown, etc. Without a common reporter, we would need to go to adapt this backend test framework for each of jasmine/mocha/cucumber. 

That being said, developers are more than welcome to add more useful output to resultJsonOutputFile if it is useful or modify the current output if it doesn't make sense. However, for your case, implementing new reporters for test frameworks (i.e. jasmine/mocha/cucumber) is not the responsibility of protractor. What if tomorrow another person comes and wants resultJsonOutputFile to report a different output that breaks your conversion to .xml, but say helps conversion to .html? That's why protractor is built so that people can easily attach other reporter modules to it, so that everyone can use the most appropriate report for their use case, and not try to implement all reporters itself.

That bit works fine.  I have tried lots of different options to then use the arrow keys to move down the list of options, none of which worked.  How do I use the arrow keys to move to an option and then select it with ENTER?

I am trying to automate the page with just keys to prove the page is accessible and also to test that it works for power users who prefer keyboard to mouse so click etc will not suffice.

To navigate the page with TABs I wrote this:

```
exports.tab = function (identifier) {
    browser.driver.actions().sendKeys(protractor.Key.TAB).perform().then(function () {
        browser.driver.switchTo().activeElement().getAttribute('id').then(function (id) {
            if (identifier === id) {
                console.log('found ' + id);
            } else {
                console.log('looking for ' + identifier);
                exports.tab(identifier);
            }
        });
    });
};
```

I was hoping to do something similar for KeyDown, keep pressing keyDown until the right value is selected.  The following code opens the drop down and then logs the html of the selected element which is the drop down.

```
exports.arrowDown = function (identifier) {
    return browser.driver.actions().sendKeys(protractor.Key.ARROW_DOWN).perform().then(function(){
        browser.driver.switchTo().activeElement().getAttribute('id').then(function (id) {
            element(by.id(id)).getOuterHtml().then(function(value){
                console.log(value);
            });
        });
    });
};
```
I can't even send ENTER to select the first option.

The travis webdriver tests always fail for pull requests (http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/pull-requests/#Security-Restrictions-when-testing-Pull-Requests).

Few issues:

 - The whitespace should be 4 spaces instead of tab.
 - Whats the purpose of the `dx` variable and why is it needed? The current test doesn't work at all for me with that dx value added/subtracted from the different values.
 - As the text gets rendered multiple times and the fill color is hardcoded to black, won't this break rgba colors which aren't 100% opacity?
 - `NodeParser` shouldn't directly access the canvas context, instead use the `setVariable`  or other methods / properties in the `CanvasRenderer`. 

I've added some more tests to https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/blob/master/tests/cases/text/shadow.html
(including some with the opacity issue) but would be nice to have some more.

As for fixing this up - I think it's pretty clear that these changes are required, but in order to do them we need to add filtering abilities to the API:

- filter out tags with 0 posts
- filter out authors with 0 posts

Tags do already have a concept of post_count, but there's no way to filter the API based on this property. Authors don't have a concept of post_count.

The main question I guess would be how to do filtering based on a post_count property. As a simple version we could use a negation syntax like: `?include=post_count&post_count=-0` to mean include `post_count` and don't return items where the post_count is 0. 

Using `-` for negation comes from the idea of using gmail style filtering in other places. E.g. tags=""fred, -bob"" means has the tag fred and doesn't have the tag bob.

Another potential syntax is json-style, `post_count={gt: 0}` to mean include items where post_count is greater than 0. As well as `gt` we could support less than (`lt`), equals (`eq`) and not equals (`neq`).

I think both syntaxes have merit and slightly different purposes. We haven't implemented anything like this in the API yet, but there's likely to be need for both negation and comparison as we move forward.

I think a good place to add the function would be at https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/lib/runner.js#L189

- [ ] Ordering (specific to a post, alphabetical, and by number of posts)
- [ ] Visibility / Private tags

---

In order to ship tag management we need to deliver a minimum working version. Here's what we think it should look like: 

![screenshot of simple tag list](http://puu.sh/cZyOy.png)

This list shows each tag in a list. The list needs to have infinite scroll applied to it, much the same as the users or posts list. The number on the right is the number of posts that the tag is associated with.

Clicking on any one of the tags in the list will open up the 'tag settings menu' or TSM :)

![screenshot of edit screen](http://puu.sh/cZAA0.png)

This allows for editing the tag name, slug, description, and post cover image. There is also a meta data screen the same as in the post settings menu. Editing the slug updates a live URL preview.

This screen should only appear for users with the role 'Editor' or higher.

Development How-To
===================
The tags UI is hidden behind a feature flag! To see, use, and develop with the tags settings you must set `tagsUI: true` in the `development` object of your `config.js`. 

E.g:

```
development: {
    url: 'http://localhost:2368',
    tagsUI: true,
    ...
```

---- 

With the addition of the ability to fetch the next and previous post via the API, we need to make it possible for theme developers to access this functionality.

The [{{#get}}](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/4439) helper provides one avenue for doing this, something like:

```
{{#get ""posts"" id=""current-post-id"" include=""next,prev""}}
    {{#prev}}<a href=""{{url}}"">{{title}}</a>{{/prev}}
    {{#next}}<a href=""{{url}}"">{{title}}</a>{{/next}}
{{/get}}
```

However, that's a little unintuitive for a feature like this (which is highly requested and likely to be used by a large number of people). So it makes sense to provide a slightly nicer set of helpers.

`{{next_post}}` and `{{prev_post}}`

As each of these will fetch all of the properties of a post, they'll need to work as a block helper:

i.e. `{{#next_post}}}<a href=""{{url}}"">{{title}}</a>{{/next_post}}` and `{{#prev_post}}}<a href=""{{url}}"">{{title}}</a>{{/prev_post}}`. 

Each helper will need to determine the current post ID, make a query to the API to fetch the data, and then ensure the data is provided such that helpers like `{{title}}` and `{{url}}` will work correctly inside the block.",[themes],[f7c6c7],[0],[],101513,ErisDS,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-13 21:56:42,2015-01-13 21:56:42,0,,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

Hi. Apologies if this has been fixed in the master branch - I skimmed the search results and couldn't see a matching issue posted.

So, every time I go into Settings > Users, the Role will always default to Administrator, even if they are saved as something else. Yet, if I make an amendment to another field and save, it doesn't pick up the Administrators selection on the Users page.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Log into Admin.
2. Go to Settings, then Users.
3. Choose any user (ideally a non-admin) and click.
4. Note their Role compared to what displays on the User page.
5. Make amendments. Save.
6. Recheck Users page.
7. Repeat 4-6.

These servers are behind a NAT, and there's an Elastic Load Balancer which directs traffic in round-robin fashion to distribute load among the servers.

When there's a Facebook authentication, the callback response may go to the same server that issued the request, but sometimes it goes to the wrong server (because browsing traffic can be directed to any webserver in the stack).  So if we reduce the number of webservers to 1, everything works great.  If we increase the number of webservers and increase traffic, the client hangs waiting for the callback.

I'm looking for a best-practice way of addressing this use case.

EDIT1: I'm beginning to look into how to approach this problem using a server dedicated to handling the Facebook callback (which I'll call an authentication server).  For a Facebook authentication request on a webserver, the webserver has to make a request to the authentication server for it to do the Facebook authentication and respond with a Facebook token.  I'm not sure how the cookies get forwarded in this case (from the webserver to the authentication server) - I'm just somewhat new to node.js and passport programming.

EDIT2: The other alternative would be for AWS to provide support (if it's not already there - but I don't think it is) for a webserver to query the NAT to find out what outside port it's on, and the ELB to forward traffic according to specific port when given in the callback URL.

It does not turn on sending cookies in the XMLHttpRequest by default.  And it should not be done - the server needs to confirm it and if it does not, which is the default behaviour, the entire AJAX call fails.  It is a protection against XSRF attacks; only some REST APIs perform the authorization using cookies, usually only partially.  See [withCredentials & Access-Control-Allow-Credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Requests_with_credentials).

You should still set `jqxhr.xhrFields = { withCredentials: true }` or `xhr.withCredentials = true` somewhere.  An ugly solution would be [modifying the JQueryHttpClient's execute method to do it before calling `$.ajax`](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/dist/lib/swagger.js#L1404).  Optimally the `SwaggerUi` could include an additional option for this, for example:

    new SwaggerUi({
          url: ""http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs"",
              dom_id: ""swagger-ui-container"",
              useJQuery: true,
              withCredentials: true,
             ...

If the `ShredHttpClient` could be modified to support it, it would work only for the `JQueryHttpClient`.

A solution without modifying Swagger would be registering an `$.ajaxTransport` for all data types, creating a usual `XMLHttpRequest` instance there and set the `withCredentials` flag on it right away.

I think that the SwaggerUi should offer a flag for it, unless it allows you to access the `$.ajax` instance or to propagate options to it somehow.",[],[],[],[],127756,klacointe,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2013-11-08 15:25:54,2015-01-14 09:08:12,7,2014-07-11 05:46:57,69887745,2015-01-14 09:08:12,2015-01-14 09:08:12,COLLABORATOR,733193,prantlf,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

Back then, bookshelf didn't support subqueries, we didn't have a clear plan for the API, and we didn't have any idea about having a query helper. All of these things combined to make this issue quite tricky to solve.

The solution that was put forward was an always-on addition to the API which meant making 2 extra queries for every post page. This seemed like unnecessary overhead for the `GET /posts/` request for a feature that wouldn't be used by everyone. Not having performance tests made it riskier.

Now that we have a clearer idea of what our API is supposed to look like (in short, JSON API but with inline objects rather than `linked`), it is much easier to design clean solutions to problems like this one. The proposal for adding next & previous support to the API is to update the posts endpoint to accept `next` and `previous` as `includes` E.g.

GET `/posts/?include=next,previous`

It should be possible to add one or both of these options, and get the corresponding post returned in the response in the following format:

```
{
    posts: [{
        id: 1,
        title: 'Something here',
        ...
        next: { 
             id: 6,
             title: 'Another post thing',
             ...
        }
    }]
}
```

Implementing this at the model level is going to require some fancy bookshelf-ery. May be worth using the subquery support here. Performance testing would be very much appreciated.

Notes:

- `next` is the post published after the current post, so should be more recent
- `previous` is the post published before
- If the `next` or `previous` posts are requested but don't exist because we are at one end of the list or another, the key should be included, but the body should be null.
- To make the API consistent, we should always return `next` and `previous` keys with the id of the post, such that adding them to `include` causes the whole object to be included, rather than the keys to magically appear. This definitely needs perf tests and will likely be a separate issue.
- This is just an API addition and won't make this feature available to themes","[api, help wanted]","[FA18A8, 009800]","[0, 0]","[, ]",101513,ErisDS,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2014-10-10 07:29:02,2015-01-14 09:32:07,7,2015-01-14 09:32:07,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

I have a pretty complex mobile-app with 2 webviews, where one of them has angular embedded and the other doesn't.

When calling wdBrowser.contexts I get an array which looks like that:  [ 'NATIVE_APP', 'WEBVIEW_1', 'WEBVIEW_5' ]

Most of the times contexts[1] is the angular embedded one, but when it is not my automation tests fail because of the requirement for angular.

Does anyone have a workaround for changing the context to the angular embedded webview in 100% of the times?

I tried to inspect the webview's url the after choosing it, but non angular webview throws an exception when using getCurrentUrl() : 'Error while waiting for Protractor to sync with the page'

I need some help and i did not know where to turn to. The question is: 
Do we have this functionality in mocha, or is this a new feature?

More details: 
I'm trying to use mocha to code some DB tests. Assume the following structure

```
migrate db to current version:
    setup:  
        - connect as admin 
        - create test db
        - close admin connection
        - run 'create-db' of previous version
    the migration flow:
        setup: connect to test db
        should pass with no errors:
            setup: begin transaction
            - alter tables & SPs
            - add built-in records to root tables
            teardown: decide if to commit or rollback
        run of sanity test sqls should pass with no errors:
            setup: begin transaction
            - insert demi data
            - execute some ETL sp
            teardown: decide if to pass or fail, but ALWAYS rollback
        teardown: db close connection
    teardown:
        - connect as admin 
        - connect to main db
        - close connection
```

Now, this flow makes great sense.
In fact, all the `the migration flow` section is a code that if we could abort it on first error, and take decisions on the teardown - it would even be safe enough to run as part of rollout to production db itself.

Now since a DB rollout happens on some DevOps machine that would talk to the db, there's no problem running mocha there, and have the communication with the db a side-effect of running the suite, and enjoying the explicitness of the spec reporter, the well-programmed waterfall, and all the rest :)


But - for that, I should be able to *abort* a suite with all it's yet-to-be-exectuted steps, *without skipping hooks* like teardown/afterall hooks.

I found the `Runner.prototype.abort` API and it looks almost like what I need - except for the fact it aborts the entire execution, and not only the current suite - but if it works I might be able to live with that.
But I did not find a way to access the runner from code of user-function for test or for a hook...

Do we have this functionality in mocha, or is this a new feature?


P.S
The only place I saw `runner.abort()` used is the `process.on('SIGINT', function() { runner.abort(); }) on the CLI file in bin. 
Is this how it's intended to be used? sounds hacky to me...
I need some confirmation that I'm not abusing this whole thing before I'll feel good with harsh statements like `process.emit('SIGINT')`...

Any word would be a helo :)

Thanks for bearing with me

Hi. Apologies if this has been fixed in the master branch - I skimmed the search results and couldn't see a matching issue posted.

So, every time I go into Settings > Users, the Role will always default to Administrator, even if they are saved as something else. Yet, if I make an amendment to another field and save, it doesn't pick up the Administrators selection on the Users page.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Log into Admin.
2. Go to Settings, then Users.
3. Choose any user (ideally a non-admin) and click.
4. Note their Role compared to what displays on the User page.
5. Make amendments. Save.

Actually, I just tested this on IE9 and found it to not be true (anymore?). Seems this may have been patched within the past ~4 years; according to [a Microsoft blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/05/13/xdomainrequest-restrictions-limitations-and-workarounds.aspx):

> Note: As of 2014, XDomainRequest doesn't appear to send any Content-Type header at all. It's not clear to me when this changed.

Which means the content type of the returned resource can be anything, including image.

And so it could be worth it to reopen this issue and try using `XDomainRequest` (if available) when we find that XHR doesn't support CORS.

Thoughts?

(Another, related optimization for image loading should be to allow both the `proxy` and `useCORS` options to be specified in the same invocation, with the behavior in that case being ""attempt CORS, and if that fails, fall back to the proxy."" The current logic ignores the proxy if `useCORS` is `true`.)",[],[],[],[],3254606,samsonkhisty,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2014-07-24 18:53:51,2015-01-14 15:57:34,3,2014-10-19 19:56:27,69938064,2015-01-14 15:57:34,2015-01-14 15:57:34,COLLABORATOR,1373334,usmonster,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

More concretely, we've been added to the ""EasyPrivacy"" blacklist https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easyprivacy.txt — which blocks loading any script called `bugsnag-*`, or any 3rd-party request to `bugsnag.com`.

There are two partial workarounds that I see:
1. Host `bugsnag-2.js` on your own server under a different name. This will allow the Bugsnag script to load so that any references to `Bugsnag` will work rather than raising an error.
2. Check for `if (Bugsnag)` before trying to use the Bugsnag object.
These won't fix notifications (as they are blocked by the other rule), but will allow your javascript that interacts with Bugsnag to keep working.

If we added js support to [bugsnag-agent](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-agent) then we could let you send notifications via your own domain without installing [Bugsnag Enterprise](https://bugsnag.com/enterprise); but to be honest, if users want to avoid being tracked enough to install something that causes as many problems as adblock, then we should probably respect their decision.

I am writing a custom reporter and i have to wait for IO write.  My reporter function gets trigger in onComplete method. How to implicitly put wait on onComplete?

I have tried below ways.

1.browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20000);

2.onComplete: function() {
      browser.wait(function() {
      ....
      finalreport.generateHtmlReport();
      },20000);
      },

None of the above worked. Any other working solutions...

The list of navigation items should be stored as a JSON object in the settings table. 

This means creating a new [default setting](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/data/default-settings.json) called `navigation` with the type `blog`.
It should have one default item: ""Home"" - pointing at the root URL, which will be stored as just `/`.

On save, the values from the interface should be serialized into a JSON object and saved via the settings API.

The JSON object needs to contained ordered name and url pairs, something like:

```
{[
    {name: 'Home', url: '/'}
]}
```

* Pressing the `+` button should add another new row / item
* Pressing the save button should save all the rows which are not blank 
* Pressing the trash icon should remove the row / item
* Drag and drop reordering is dealt with in  #4540

I think the base URL should be stripped from the start of each URL when it is stored, so that we only store relative paths (and the navigation continues to function if the URL changes). If the URL doesn't start with the base URL, then we store and use the absolute URL.","[data, ember, settings]","[C0E5C8, e1563f, B3B2A8]","[0, 0, 0]","[, , ]",101513,ErisDS,User,COLLABORATOR,214142,jaswilli,[],[],2014-11-28 18:15:32,2015-01-14 22:45:04,0,2015-01-14 22:45:04,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

However, the hostname and certificate had a mismatch, which caused the client to repeatedly disconnect and attempt to reconnect. rippled server logs include repeated entries that include this when the client disconnects and reconnects:
```

It would better if ripple-lib emitted an error event rather than repeatedly trying to connect to a host with a mismatched certificate.

It is a very useful feature that lowers the work for the server and reduces wait time of that call, so it should be supported.

you're right about setup / teardown - that's where im going, I suppose I wrote it there for verbosity.

terminating the process is not considerable - we will lose the teardown...

about replacing the logic that would call runner.abort - that's the problem:
I can't find the access to runner from user-code - it looks like intentionally decoupled
maybe I don't understand what you say, but if I wanted to do that I would need to manipulate Runner.prototype.abort - which sounds to me worse than emitting SIGINT...

I have a pretty complex mobile-app with 2 webviews, where one of them has angular embedded and the other doesn't.

When calling wdBrowser.contexts I get an array which looks like that:  [ 'NATIVE_APP', 'WEBVIEW_1', 'WEBVIEW_5' ]

Most of the times contexts[1] is the angular embedded one, but when it is not my automation tests fail because of the requirement for angular.

Does anyone have a workaround for changing the context to the angular embedded webview in 100% of the times?

Here is a unit test that replicates this issue (in Coffee-Script):

```coffee

app        = require '../../app'


describe.only 'swagger', ->
  page = QA_NWR_API.create(before, after)

It looks like this is 'by design' since for example the [swagger-node-express](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node-express/blob/master/sample-application/app.js) takes advantage of this 'feature'  to add a link to its description: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node-express/blob/master/sample-application/app.js#L83-L90

I don't think that this is a high risk security issue, but it would be good to either:

a) add a note to the documentation (referencing this issue) with an alert to be careful with the ```swagger.apiInfo.description``` value, or
b) use markdown for the description value (which will allow features like links, without the html scripting capability)

I am using sequelize-cli to migrate new changes to my running solution. Basically, creating a workflow for pushing updates to my MySQL server hosting my test db. I have one migration file named `20141218140725-create-cafe-owner.js` created using the CLI's `migration:create` command. I used the `db:migrate` command and it borked giving me this error:

```
D:\WampDeveloper\Websites\www.example.com\webroot\api_dev>sequelize db:migrate

Sequelize [Node: 0.10.21, CLI: 1.0.0, ORM: 2.0.0-dev9]

[17:24:19] 'db:migrate' errored after 51 ms Unable to resolve the storage: sequelize

D:\WampDeveloper\Websites\www.example.com\webroot\api_dev>
```


Here's my migration file `migrations/20141218140725-create-cafe-owner.js` :

```javascript
""use strict"";
module.exports = {
  up: function(migration, DataTypes, done) {
    migration.createTable(""CafeOwners"", {
      id: {
        allowNull: false,
        autoIncrement: true,
        primaryKey: true,
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER
      },
      email: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING(100)
      },
      password: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING(255)
      },
      lastLogin: {
        allowNull: true,
        type: DataTypes.DATE,
      },
      createdAt: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: DataTypes.DATE
      },
      updatedAt: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: DataTypes.DATE
      },
      deletedAt: {
        allowNull: true,
        type: DataTypes.DATE
      },
    }).done(done);
  },
  down: function(migration, DataTypes, done) {
    migration.dropTable(""CafeOwners"").done(done);
  }
};
```
For the sake of completeness, here's my `config/config.json` file as well:
```json
{
  ""development"": {
    ""username"": ""dbuser"",
    ""password"": ""test123"",
    ""database"": ""sequelize_test"",

    ""dialect"": ""mysql""
  }
}

```

I tried to dig through the source, but I am still learning production JS and it seems quite complicated to follow where it's going wrong. After trying to look up this error on Google, I found something about the `Sequelize_meta` table, but could not find such a table in my database.

Can anyone guide me in the right direction to alleviate this problem?",[unclear],[fad8c7],[0],[],3892333,jagged3dge,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2014-12-19 12:27:12,2015-01-15 19:18:49,40,2015-01-15 19:18:49,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

tldr is:

You can configure your configuration file to point an environment to a specific environment variable, which is supposed to contain a database URL:

```
{
  ""production"": {
    ""use_env_variable"": ""DB_HOST""
  }
}
```

In that case the CLI will load the env var `DB_HOST` and throw it into the url module to parse it.

This is harmful because the `sourcesContent` output breaks variable linking.

I noticed that with grunt-autoprefixer running, cmd-clicking a value set by a variable no longer linked to the variable definition, and instead linked to the rule. After experimenting with various settings, I found that the sourcesContent property in the source map file seems incompatible with Chrome's variable linking. 

I set map.sourceContent:false, and found that grunt-autoprefixer was still generating source maps with sourcesContent.

----

This issue covers the rules of what the default value for the URL field should be, and how it should behave, for each item in the Navigation UI:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/120485/5228785/917b5448-7717-11e4-9b1d-1e24a48e5729.png)

Entering a relative URL will be very common, so to make this easier, the base url should be provided as a default url, rather than as a placeholder. It should follow these rules:

* By default, the value should be the blog's base URL (including subdirectory)
* if value === base url, set the colour like a placeholder, else colour is black like a value 
* on focus, the colour is always black like a value
* if value === base url on click/focus always puts the cursor at the end
* if value === base url, and cursor is at the end, pressing backspace should delete the whole url
* if value === null on focus-out then the base url should be re-inserted

This should make it easy to add a relative URL, and to clear the field to enter an external url.

In future, it'd be great to add autocomplete / suggestions to this input ;)","[ember, settings]","[e1563f, B3B2A8]","[0, 0]","[, ]",101513,ErisDS,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-15 22:24:13,2015-01-15 22:24:13,0,,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

This is a fantastic summary @ErisDS! Thanks.

@claydiffrient My real-world cases are quite limited to the following:
- phonegap-cli@4.1.2 `/phonegap-cli-4-1-2/`
- PhoneGap Vancouver Meetup @ 7:30pm `/phonegap-vancouver-meetup-7-30pm/`

This boils down to `- @ . :` as the special characters that I use. The `:` could become a `-` or simply removed. However, I prefer @ErisDS's simple and predictable approach over building special characters for certain characters because you can't satisfy everyone :)

@claydiffrient While I'm unfamiliar with the Ghost code-base, commit f354a1b looks clean, well written, and complete to @ErisDS's outline. Nice work!

**Problem:**

With such a request:

/this/{test}/is/{testABC}/a/{testABCDEF}/test/{other}/of/{otherABC}/swagger/{otherDEF}/ui

The swagger-ui generates the right parameters in the UI.

But, when I press the `Try it` button, the value of the parameter `test` is placed on all the `{test*}` and `other` is placed on all the `{other*}`, in the Request URL.

**Example:**

I made a screenshot:

I don't know how to fix it properly, but as a workaround, you can force the browser to scroll to the top of the screen before making the screenshot. Make sure you make the screenshot after the scroll has completed, to leave the browser time to actually repaint before capturing.

```javascript
                   var maybeScrollAndMakeScreenshot = function() {
                        if (window.scrollY > 0) {

When they release the compatible version (firefox/driver), do I have to update the ```webdriver-manager``` or will ```protractor``` have to be updated as well?

Basically, irrelevant of the result of the if-statement, Protractor is still trying to find the element specified within the if-statement.

Here is the code that is still running even though the if-statement returned false:

                if (thisIsAlwaysFalse == true) {
                    
                    console.log(':::::::::::::::' + thisIsAlwaysFalse);
                    it('If-statement test', function(done) {

                        var elementToFind= element(by.xpath('//td[contains(@class,""hello"")]'));                  

                        browser.wait(function() {
                            return browser.isElementPresent(elementToFind);
                        }, 5000);            

                        elementToFind.click();

                        done();
                    });        
                }

Also, funny thing is that the console.log part is successfully ignored!

Basically, irrelevant of the result of the if-statement, Protractor is still trying to find the element specified within the if-statement.

Here is the code that is still running even though the if-statement returned false:

I've been reviewing this a little bit more.

My site is already configured in **https** but browser is getting TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS because there are a infinite redirection loop caused by this code in 
core/server/middleware/index.js
````
function isSSLrequired(isAdmin) {
    var forceSSL = url.parse(config.url).protocol === 'https:' ? true : false;
    
    var forceAdminSSL = (isAdmin && config.forceAdminSSL);
        
    if (forceSSL || forceAdminSSL) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}

// Check to see if we should use SSL
// and redirect if needed
function checkSSL(req, res, next) {
    if (isSSLrequired(res.isAdmin)) {
        if (!req.secure) {
            var forceAdminSSL = config.forceAdminSSL,
                redirectUrl;

            // Check if forceAdminSSL: { redirect: false } is set, which means
            // we should just deny non-SSL access rather than redirect
            if (forceAdminSSL && forceAdminSSL.redirect !== undefined && !forceAdminSSL.redirect) {
                return res.sendStatus(403);
            }

            redirectUrl = url.parse(config.urlSSL || config.url);
            return res.redirect(301, url.format({
                protocol: 'https:',
                hostname: redirectUrl.hostname,
                port: redirectUrl.port,
                pathname: req.path,
                query: req.query
            }));
        }
    }
    next();
}
```` 

Looks like

````
var forceSSL = url.parse(config.url).protocol === 'https:' ? true : false;
```` 
Is **returning true** when site is already running on **https**, but if ghost  is already configured to run over **https** and IIS is redirecting http traffic to https there's no need to redirect again.

I suggest the right valitation could be.

```` 
//if site is already running over https there is no need to forceSSL
var forceSSL = url.parse(config.url).protocol === 'https:' ? false:true;
```` 

On IIS you configure a website to run over https with this rule in web.config file:

```` 
        <rule name=""Force HTTPS"" enabled=""true"">
          <match url=""(.*)"" ignoreCase=""false"" />
          <conditions>
            <add input=""{HTTPS}"" pattern=""off"" />
          </conditions>
          <action type=""Redirect"" url=""https://{HTTP_HOST}/{R:1}"" appendQueryString=""true"" redirectType=""Permanent"" />
        </rule>
```` 

So because of that my current blog **config.js** is configured `forceAdminSSL: false`
----
Actually **isSSLrequired** method execution looks like
````
function isSSLrequired(isAdmin) {
//forceSSL = true;
var forceSSL = url.parse(config.url).protocol === 'https:' ? true : false;
//forceAdminSSL = false;
//true && false = false
var forceAdminSSL = (isAdmin && config.forceAdminSSL);

//true || false = true
if (forceSSL || forceAdminSSL) {
    ///TRUE    
    return true;
    }
    return false;:
}
````

That method reponse is causing that `checkSSL` method redirect url over **https** even if url is already over **https**.

For test purposes I've changed the code in my own repository and looks everything is working ok.

Dunno if that will work.  Otherwise you'll probably want a symlink.

Given that `mocha` executes `node` itself (which is strange to me; if you want `node` flags, why not just run `node /path/to/mocha`?), if a non-symlinked setup becomes more prevalent, maybe it's a good idea to ditch support for `node` flags.

1. `npm install ghost`
2. index.js
```javascript
/*

Command:
 NODE_ENV=development node index

Result (expected):
 config.paths.contentPath = /path/to/project-root/content/

Command:
 NODE_ENV=production node index

Result (unexpected!):

 config.paths.themePath = /path/to/project-root/node_modules/ghost/content/themes
 
 */

var path = require('path');
var ghost = require('ghost');

ghost({
    config: path.join(__dirname, 'config.js'),
    contentPath: path.join(__dirname, 'content')
}).then(function (ghostServer) {
    
    console.log ('Current mode is ' + process.env.NODE_ENV);
    
    // contentPath and themePath are different in production and development mode!
    console.log('config.paths.contentPath = ' + ghostServer.config.paths.contentPath);
    console.log('config.paths.themePath = ' + ghostServer.config.paths.themePath);
    
    ghostServer.start();
});
```
Run `NODE_ENV=development node index`. Result:
```
Current mode is development

Support for io.js needs to land in nvm before it can be used on Travis-CI.

Extending what @jgable said, io.js is (obviously) really new, and there's going to have to be a bit of lag while tooling catches up and the dust settles.  At the point when we can easily install it we'll be able to give it a shakedown and see what kind of issues we have with our dependencies, ES6 feature conflicts, etc.

1. `.compile()` returns a function, not a string
   - I cannot think of any occasion that returning a client function in function form would ever be helpful. All tests for client mode uses a `.toString()`.
   - Jade returns a string.
2. The current API does not allow changing the function name of the output function, making it impossible to have more than one functions in a webpage without manual `var thisIsTheNameIWant = eval(str)`
   - This is extremely awkward for users who want to embed their function string in a HTML `data-` attribute.
   - Jade fixes this making `options.name` represent the name of the function.
   - Currently the output function is called `anonymous()`, which is plain stupid (Jade uses `template()`).

Both of these points cannot be done without breaking backward compat.","[bug, enhancement]","[fc2929, 84b6eb]","[0, 0]","[, ]",1538624,TimothyGu,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-17 01:19:01,2015-01-17 01:19:01,0,,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

* Because it's without included bower and npm packages you have to install NodeJS packages using `npm install` and bower packages using `bower install`

Autoprefixer is included in Gruntfile by default. You can see that some CSS selectors are referring to complied css

When editing a post on mobile (see technical details for my specific use case) the input area becomes small and does not scroll properly. This causes the input text to become hidden under the action bar, and makes it difficult to author anything on mobile. Related to #2815 and still present in #4373.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Login to ghost from your mobile phone.
2. Create a new post
3. Input more than 2 lines of text

This is a bug because it makes mobile editing difficult and cumbersome.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Enter a new footnote: `This is a great text[^12]`
2. The preview / html will show it as `This is a great text^12` instead of `This is a great text<sup>12</sup>`

This is a bug because it works with numbers < 10 and should work with numbers >= 10.

Footnotes can be numerated. This works for footnotes up to the number 9 after which the number will not properly be put into superscript.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Enter a new footnote: `This is a great text[^12]`
2. The preview / html will show it as `This is a great text^12` instead of `This is a great text<sup>12</sup>`

This is a bug because it works with numbers < 10 and should work with numbers >= 10.

```
core/server/api/authentication.js:49:                var baseUrl = config.forceAdminSSL ? (config.urlSSL || config.url) : config.url,
core/server/api/users.js:48:        var baseUrl = config.forceAdminSSL ? (config.urlSSL || config.url) : config.url;
core/server/api/mail.js:88:                siteUrl: config.forceAdminSSL ? (config.urlSSL || config.url) : config.url
```

In all cases, if `forceAdminSSL` is set but `urlSSL` is not, an insecure Url will be used, when the configuration option clearly requested to force SSL. 

Why not update the validation of `config.forceAdminSSL` to require that  `config.urlSSL` also be set if `config.forceAdminSSL` is set?  Then all three locations above could be simplified to definitely  use `config.urlSSL`  when `config.forceAdminSSL` is set, instead of returning an insecure Url when the config requested that secure one be forced.",[],[],[],[],25829,markstos,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-18 03:09:09,2015-01-18 03:09:09,0,,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

   - I cannot think of any occasion that returning a client function in function form would ever be helpful. All tests for client mode uses a `.toString()`.
   - Jade returns a string.
2. The current API does not allow changing the function name of the output function, making it impossible to have more than one functions in a webpage without manual `var thisIsTheNameIWant = eval(str)`
   - This is extremely awkward for users who want to embed their function string in a HTML `data-` attribute.
   - Jade fixes this making `options.name` represent the name of the function.
   - Currently the output function is called `anonymous()`, which is plain stupid (Jade uses `template()`).

Both of these points cannot be done without breaking backward compat.",[enhancement],[84b6eb],[0],[],1538624,TimothyGu,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-17 01:19:01,2015-01-18 06:24:53,4,2015-01-18 06:24:53,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

Handlebars calls it ""expression"" but at the same time uses the word for loops and conditionals too.

I'm less interested in micro-optimizations especially in libraries which will be used in multiple JS implementations, over a long period of time. Granted, this isn't bending over backward to tweak the perf numbers in one specific engine, but I put a priority on just writing good, idiomatic JavaScript, as long as it's reasonably performant.

Your changes to the escape function are a great example of something I had done in a really dumb way, and was having a big, obvious impact on perf. That's the kind of stuff I worry about.

FWIW, linters *do* catch some of the stupid stuff I do sometimes, so I think they're useful. :)

A lot of other platforms make the visual distinction between **navigation** and the actual **content** like you're proposing here. One downside with it is that it cripples the publishing flow somewhat since most of the time you're first ""writing content"", and the ""attching it"" to a structure. In other words you're transforming a simple task into a two-step process.

Also, for the person writing the content, the only point of separating the navigation structure from the pages is if it's possible to create several navigation structures and publish the same page in several of them at the same time.

A simpler way to present this to the user would maybe be to create a new view called Pages/Site/Whatever where the navigation structure is shown. Here users can create ""pages"" of different kinds, for example:

* Content page (post with `page=1`)
* Tag archive
* Internal link (i.e to another post)
* External link

When the user creates a new entry the new post is created together with the navigation item in a single transaction, making it seemless for the user and turning it into a single step. If this kind of view was created, then maybe it would also be logical to filter out posts with `page=1` from the post list.

In other words, the same underlying structure could be used, it's just presented in a different way.

Btw, I really love the project!

After spending a couple hours debugging it I have found that it somehow seems to be related to the number of tests. However, that's not purely the problem because running thousands of near-blank tests in a new project works fine.

For me, if I go over 103 tests, about 70% of the time it fails at test 77 with:
```
PhantomJS 1.9.8 (Linux) ERROR
  Script error.
```

It doesn't seem to matter where I add the tests in my current project, or what is in the tests (even if they are blank). 

However, as mentioned, if I start up a fresh project, randomly add a few thousand near-blank tests, it works fine.

Weird. Not sure how to continue debugging it at this point. Though it feels like it might be a memory leak somewhere.

   https://github.com/JoshWillik/Ghost/commit/c77bed6c97c2301a4f930ffd31f516fa340dd296

I rebased it on to master to make sure it still applied cleanly, which it does.

I checked for test coverage of the related checkSSL middleware and found no unit tests,
presumably because of the dependencies on `config`, `req` and `res`.

I added a commit which is purely a refactor which moves most of `checkSSL` into
a unit-testable routine and added several unit tests for it.

Since the routine was not tested, I moved it from the middleware/index.js to
middleware/middleware.js as the docs say that the later is the location for
unit-testable middleware.

shows the logic change, the latter is a refactor.

5 hours apart from each other-- the difference from laptop's native time zone

After explicitly setting the time zone to UTC, the tests pass as expected.

This issue may not manifest itself on Travis, or Vagrant Linux VMs on Mac,

There are some really nice things about our migration system, in fact someone proposed [knex steal it](https://github.com/tgriesser/knex/issues/127). 

### Ghost Migrations

Our migrations work by us modifying the `schema.js` file, and updating the databaseVersion number in `default-settings.json`. When Ghost starts, it checks the number in `default-settings.json` against the local database version, and if number in Ghost is higher it knows it needs to perform some migrations.

It then runs a comparison between the local database and `schema.js`, figures out what has changed, and generates the alter table and alter column statements to update the database. That means that when we release a new version of Ghost, if the database version number changes, then when a user upgrades the migrations will automatically run. 

Sometimes if you're on master (especially if you're a developer) you can get stuck because the database version number changes in one commit, and one of the `schema.js` updates doesn't happen until a later commit. The workaround for this is to start Ghost with a `FORCE_MIGRATION=true` env var. This forces Ghost to compare the local database with `schema.js` and then generate and run any migrations that are required.

It all works pretty neatly, and the REALLY nice thing about it is that it is all based on a big JSON object that describes the database, which is useful for other aspects of models and validations.

### The Downside(s)...

There are a few downsides to our migration system. One big one is having to maintain it - knex doesn't yet fully support all the possible alter operations that you might want to do on a database, so as it adds more options, we need to add them to the possible statements that can be generated by our system.

More importantly, Ghost's migration system focuses 100% on the database structure, and has no provision for modifying the data in the database. In systems like ActiveRecord, migrations often contain data modifications as well, useful for doing things like changing default values.

Ghost has a [fixtures system](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/tree/master/core/server/data/fixtures) which is totally separate, and is little more than some hard-coded functions which detect if migrations are going through a database version and therefore need to adjust some data. Deep within this, are the [permissions fixtures](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/tree/master/core/server/data/fixtures/permissions), which are woefully lacking in any sort of [migration capability](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/3910) and this is holding us up from adding new permissions.

Meanwhile, Knex has added its own [migration system](http://knexjs.org/#Migrations) based on ActiveRecord and more recently added the concept of [seed files](http://knexjs.org/#Seeds-CLI). 

**So the big question: is the system in Knex now more sophisticated than ours, will it solve our fixtures problems, as well as other [migration issues](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/4687#issuecomment-70423880) and should we switch?**

It's reliable to set `process.env.TZ` provided that you do it just once and do so before other time-zone related code runs. That is what I've done here, and is what I have been successfully in our app in production for months. We develop in Eastern, run our servers in UTC but our app is deployed to serve   users in four time zones currently. 

Declaring UTC as a default once at the very beginning of processing is less error-prone than remembering to explicitly declare UTC at every point in the code that processes code. 

To try reproduce the test failure without the patch, try this:

    TZ=""America/New_York"" grunt test-unit

You also try try modifying my patch to set `process.env.TZ=""America/New_York""` as well.

If you instead go the route of assuming that the Markdown files you are imported have UTC times in the filename then that should be mentioned in the import docs as part of the ""spec"" of the importer. If third-parties are generating data to match this spec, that's an important detail to know.

That was intent. Like the practice using specific fixture data for
tests, setting a specific time zone for tests give you reliable and
consistent baseline time-zone for the tests.

True. From what I saw of the related import ticket, there was a not a
spec yet for how to interpret the time data in Markdown file names.
Expecting that data to be UTC would certainly be convenient, as there's
not a place in the markdown import spec currently to convey time zone
data.

As I understand, `grunt test-unit` (and other test invocations) start
their own node process, run tests and shuts down the process. Any
`process.env.TZ` value set within would apply only to that process and
expire with the process exits at the end of the test run. I don't see
any side-effect of this affecting a running Ghost server, which is not
the same node process as any of the `grunt test` commands.

I was only striving to help the test suite run consistently in different
time zones, since it was failing in the Eastern time zone for me.

Yes, that's correct.  I was speaking in terms of fixing this issue entirely, which would require setting `TZ` not only when running the tests, but also when a regular instance of Ghost is running.

If you want to explicitly test importing data from another time zone, then a test should explicitly set a specific time zone and then test for the specific offset from UTC.

Not controlling the time zone of tests is prone to producing unexpected results as just happened.  I've made the mistake before of letting tests run in the random environment of users before with similar failures as I recently found.

You can continue to discover time-zone related test suite bugs by waiting for the suite to be run in different zones, but I think setting UTC as a default for the test suite and explicitly testing for time-zone offsets when necessary will both avoid the unexpected failures like today as well as providing coverage for time-zone related issues.

OK, this is exceptionally lame.

3. Domains are still not deprecated according to official docs.
   - Oral deprecation is not visible enough on the Internet.
4. People still use domains.

The issue in this specific instance, as I see it, is that the importer is applying an offset to epoch time based on the local timezone (if set), but that offset isn't being recorded anywhere.  In the future when that datetime value is pulled out of the database there's no way to tell that an offset was already applied.

If we were forcing the tests to be run in an arbitrary timezone, the tests would pass but we wouldn't have discovered the issue with the importer and then we'd be hitting the bug in production instead of in testing.

`contentPath` and `themePath` are different in production and development mode when Ghost installed as npm module.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. `npm install ghost`
2. index.js
```javascript
/*
Ghost 0.5.8 installed as npm module

Command:
 NODE_ENV=development node index

Result (expected):
 config.paths.contentPath = /path/to/project-root/content/
 config.paths.themePath = /path/to/project-root/content/themes
 
Command:
 NODE_ENV=production node index

Result (unexpected!):
 config.paths.contentPath = /path/to/project-root/node_modules/ghost/content
 config.paths.themePath = /path/to/project-root/node_modules/ghost/content/themes
 
 */

var path = require('path');
var ghost = require('ghost');

ghost({
    config: path.join(__dirname, 'config.js'),
    contentPath: path.join(__dirname, 'content')
}).then(function (ghostServer) {
    
    console.log ('Current mode is ' + process.env.NODE_ENV);
    
    // contentPath and themePath are different in production and development mode!
    console.log('config.paths.contentPath = ' + ghostServer.config.paths.contentPath);
    console.log('config.paths.themePath = ' + ghostServer.config.paths.themePath);
    
    ghostServer.start();
});
```
Run `NODE_ENV=development node index`. Result:
```
Current mode is development
config.paths.contentPath = /path/to/project-root/content/
config.paths.themePath = /path/to/project-root/content/themes 
```

Run `NODE_ENV=production node index`. Result (unexpected):
```
Current mode is production
config.paths.contentPath = /path/to/project-root/node_modules/ghost/content
config.paths.themePath = /path/to/project-root/node_modules/ghost/content/themes
```

Facebook treats URLs with or without trailing slash as separate URLs. This causes a series of issues with the Facebook Scraper including the Likes counter being reset to 0 when migrating from a blogging platform that does not enforce trailing slashes on blog posts. Redirecting from a URL without a trailing slash to one with a trailing slash does not solve the issue either because Facebook follows all redirects and only looks at the canonical URL of the final destination. Due to this, migrating from other blogging platforms with social plugins is a non-option in some cases.

### Steps to Reproduce
Set up a blog with the platform of your choice and publish a post without a trailing slash. ""Like"" the post on Facebook. Migrate to Ghost (use CloudFlare or the likes to set up your custom URL). Check your ""Like"" counter on the blog post on Ghost. It will be 0 because of the trailing /.",[],[],[],[],1172528,fubhy,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-19 10:46:02,2015-01-19 10:46:02,0,,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

What I want to do is to simulate the action program flow by doing things like creating a user, and then performing other action with that user. 

I'd like to be able to separate my tests into separate files that run in order in relation to different operations, such as ""register new user"" etc. To do this I need to be able to pass values between testing files. 

Mocha contains an option setting `--globals <value1, value2, etc>`. Here is the description from the docs:

>   --globals <names>               allow the given comma-delimited global [names]


However, I've been unable to get this to work. Here's what I've tried. I have a bootstrap.test.js file that does basic before and after operations, starting and stopping sails:

    var Sails = require('sails'),
      sails;
    
    before(function(done) {
      Sails.lift({
        log: {
            level: 'error'
        }
      }, function(err, server) {
        sails = server;
        if (err) return done(err);
        // here you can load fixtures, etc.
        done(err, sails);
      });
    });
    
    after(function(done) {
      // here you can clear fixtures, etc.
      sails.lower(done);
    });

Then let's say I have two test files `a.js` and `b.js` that will run consecutively and for testing purposes contain very little:

a.js:

    var user = 'some user';

b.js:

    console.log( user );

If I then run `mocha --globals`, I get the error:

> ReferenceError: user is not defined

If I hit refresh the app loads fine though.

The angular app uses requirejs and is manually bootstrapped to a div element, so I configure rootElement in my configuration.

If I use java to write tests, they run fine and the app launches...hence I think it is a Protractor issue...

This is the logs that get output from my selenium grid instance...

I really don't consider the issue raised here to be a bug in Ghost, as I don't think it is doing anything incorrectly - the URLs are valid and consistent, the canonical URL and structured data is reported correctly and enforcing a slash is a sane thing to do for consistency. There's an automatic 301 from the non-slashed to slashed version of every URL, which solves URL problems in the majority of cases.

Raising a feature request to allow the slashes to be turned off is one course of action, but the amount of work required to make it possible is significant given the size of the underlying problem, and I'm not 100% that having the option is desirable. Further, it is a global change to your blog to solve a migration issue, which doesn't really make sense as it isn't a solution to the migration problem. There are other platforms you might migrate from, like tumblr, which can have IDs in the URL that Ghost is not able to maintain, and therefore the URL is forced to change. 

Therefore the correct course of action is to find a way to solve the problem of migrating URLs.

What is needed, is have a way to tell sharing services that the resource they are looking at is one-and-the-same as the resource they have data for. I think this can be done at least for facebook by setting the og:url to the old post. There are ways to do this for other services as well.

It is quite possible (although awkward) to resolve the issue by making modifications to the theme and/or adding extra things to the content of each post. Having a native way to resolve this would be great - it will certainly be very easy with apps and probably one of the first apps it'd be possible to build. 

I'm going to ping @cobbspur here as he's got a lot of experience of migrating blogs and solving these issues. Perhaps we can come up with a plan, whether it requires apps, or an external tool to modify the imported posts, etc - and then look at solving it that way.",[],[],[],[],1172528,fubhy,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-19 10:46:02,2015-01-19 13:36:18,4,,70492854,2015-01-19 13:36:17,2015-01-19 13:36:17,COLLABORATOR,101513,ErisDS,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

For example: You have a container that is 200x200px of size and you want to make it a perfect square. The correct border radius would be 100px - everything above won't work.

However, its a common case that people will use values much higher - mostly when you don't know exactly how the dimensions of the applied image will be. The browser automatically caps the border radius on the highest possible even value - html2canvas doesnt do that, what leads to strange effects.

I full heartedly agree. I am not saying that Ghost is at fault here in terms of how it handles the URL. It's just an unfortunate problem that arises due to the differences with the former platform. There isn't really a global consensus on the meaning of trailing slashes. Some say it means that the URL is a directory. But there is no actual standard afaik. However, I am not objecting to the idea of having trailing slashes on all URLs.

Sadly, as I understand it (I also tried it with no luck) this is not possible. It might have been a caching issue with Facebook so I can try that again but I think I also hit the refresh button on the URL Scraper Debugger over at Facebook when trying it.

Facebook seems to be the most ignorant of the common services. Twitter has no issue with the 301 redirects at all and correctly identifies the resulting blog post URL as the same as it was before.

```
core/server/api/authentication.js:49:                var baseUrl = config.forceAdminSSL ? (config.urlSSL || config.url) : config.url,
core/server/api/users.js:48:        var baseUrl = config.forceAdminSSL ? (config.urlSSL || config.url) : config.url;
core/server/api/mail.js:88:                siteUrl: config.forceAdminSSL ? (config.urlSSL || config.url) : config.url
```

In all cases, if `forceAdminSSL` is set but `urlSSL` is not, an insecure Url will be used, when the configuration option clearly requested to force SSL. 

Why not update the validation of `config.forceAdminSSL` to require that  `config.urlSSL` also be set if `config.forceAdminSSL` is set?  Then all three locations above could be simplified to definitely  use `config.urlSSL`  when `config.forceAdminSSL` is set, instead of returning an insecure Url when the config requested that secure one be forced.",[],[],[],[],25829,markstos,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-18 03:09:09,2015-01-19 17:25:35,1,2015-01-19 17:25:35,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

The code to output an error in this situation is actually already in place.  I think it stopped working at some point as a result of a side-effect in how the error logging module is configured, combined with some refactoring of the Ghost bootstrapping process.

The inclusion of `vips_cache_trim` suggests libvips is doing a cache eviction. The mention of `jpeg_finish_decompress` means it's trying to remove a JPEG-backed image object that failed to complete decompression.

I haven't looked at your PR in depth yet so I just have a note for the config: We usually try to keep the example config very slim and don't include all the defaults there. Instead they live at https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/config/index.js#L149-L195 but can be overridden when used in the config.js.

This is the only path for a shutdown of the reader, and you would expect it to come here during cache eviction.

Could this be jpeg reading from a memory buffer? If it is, it could be trying to shut down a reader attached to a memory buffer that has been freed. Could node have trashed the input buffer for some reason?

I think the rule is, if you call:

```C
int
vips_jpegload_buffer( void *buf, size_t len, VipsImage **out, ... )
```

`out` now owns the memory buffer. You must not free that buffer until `out` emits ::close.

Actually, it's stricter, I think. The jpeg reader will shut down on out::close, so the memory buffer must stay alive until out::postclose, since you don't know in what order ::close handlers will fire.",[triage],[fbca04],[0],[],60910,bkw,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-20 12:41:26,2015-01-20 14:43:23,2,,70663349,2015-01-20 14:43:23,2015-01-20 14:43:23,COLLABORATOR,580843,jcupitt,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

Here is input information

1) I'm using Swagger for Spray (https://github.com/gettyimages/spray-swagger)
2) Servlet root for my service is `/api` (and that's causes problems I think)
3) Here is how I initialize Swagger servlet
```scala
  val swaggerService = new SwaggerHttpService {
    override def apiTypes = Seq(typeOf[AuthenticateSwagger])
    override def apiVersion = ""2.0""
    override def baseUrl = ""/api"" // let swagger-ui determine the host and port
    override def docsPath = ""api-docs"" // This path is ignored by swagger-ui. There is hardcoded one in index.html
    override def actorRefFactory = context
    override def apiInfo = Some(new ApiInfo(""Innotas API"", ""Documentation on RESTful JSON-based Innotas API"", null, null, null, null))
```

Therefore Swagger json is located at `/api/api-docs` and Swagger UI at `/api/swagger/`

Now when I attempt to make request using UI it fails because Swagger-UI calls

`/api/api/authenticate`

for the sake of experiment I changed value in `baseUrl` which shockingly made requests look like

`/api2/authenticate`

I'm not familiar witj JavaScript but why would Swagger behave like that ? I couldn't find such comparison in the code (something like where it compares portions of URI).

Reading back through the issue, I see that I wasn't clear on my intentions with this refactor. The idea was to rip out the english words from the routes: the words `tag`, `author`, `page`, and `feed` which a user might wish to change either to a different thing (like genre instead of tag) or to translate - as opposed to ripping out all of the routes and making them customisable.

The idea in the end is that there will be a setting where I can change 'tag' to 'genre' or similar, but for now, there was no need to make them configurable, just doing the hard part of ensuring the routes always work. 

The big difference between putting something in our config (in which case @halfdan's comment about keeping them internally rather than in the example file is correct) vs a setting, is that a setting can be changed on-the-fly, whereas config requires a restart of Ghost. So with config you can guarantee that the strings are loaded before the routes, but with a setting you can't.

I'm not 100% which route we'd go down here - I think changing the word for a tag is likely to want to be a setting, and I have no idea how translations will be loaded.

That was the reason for leaving this refactor at the point where the strings are refactored out into an internal place, so at least changing them is done in one place - because there are other places than just the routes where those strings are hard-coded E.g: https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/config/url.js#L125 ",[],[],[],[],1410204,katiefenn,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-20 08:48:49,2015-01-20 17:32:38,4,,70695927,2015-01-20 17:32:38,2015-01-20 17:32:38,COLLABORATOR,101513,ErisDS,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

webdriver-manager update --proxy=""<my proxy>"" --ignore_ssl

to get around the proxy, but when trying to run
webdriver-manager start

I get: 
Error: Invalid or corrupt jarfile C:\Users\sam\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\
protractor\selenium\selenium-server-standalone-2.44.0.jar

I have also tried downloading the file by going to the URL, but this does not work either. Is there another version of the jar available?

----

This issue covers the rules of what the default value for the URL field should be, and how it should behave, for each item in the Navigation UI:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/120485/5228785/917b5448-7717-11e4-9b1d-1e24a48e5729.png)

Entering a relative URL will be very common, so to make this easier, the base url should be provided as a default url, rather than as a placeholder. It should follow these rules:

* By default, the value should be the blog's base URL (including subdirectory)
* if value === base url, set the colour like a placeholder, else colour is black like a value 
* on focus, the colour is always black like a value
* if value === base url on click/focus always puts the cursor at the end
* if value === base url, and cursor is at the end, pressing backspace should delete the whole url
* if value === null on focus-out then the base url should be re-inserted

This should make it easy to add a relative URL, and to clear the field to enter an external url.

In future, it'd be great to add autocomplete / suggestions to this input ;)","[ember, settings]","[e1563f, B3B2A8]","[0, 0]","[, ]",101513,ErisDS,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-15 22:24:13,2015-01-20 19:31:04,0,2015-01-20 19:31:04,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

You've never reassigned `element` to global so it's always using the original browser. 

Anyway, even if you assign element like you did with browser, it only works because you're not using the browsers in parallel. So yes it will work for this case, but once you start mixing the browser, your test will break. 

Consider:
```
it ('test', function() {
  browser = browser.a
  element = browser.a.element
  element(by.xyz).getText().then(function(text) {if (text === 'abc') {element(by.abc).click()});  
  browser = browser.b
  element = browser.b.element
})
```

Now `element(by.xyz)` will work against browser1 but `element(by.abc)` will work against browser2 because your assignment is synchronous while promises are async. You will understand what I'm saying once you start working with this.","[needs: more info, type: bug]","[bfd4f2, fc2929]","[0, 0]","[, ]",2614534,svapreddy,User,COLLABORATOR,1059345,hankduan,[],[],2014-12-16 19:40:58,2015-01-20 19:39:30,9,2014-12-22 10:14:22,70718126,2015-01-20 19:39:30,2015-01-20 19:39:30,COLLABORATOR,1059345,hankduan,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

since the class *probably* doesn't need the same uniqueness guarantees as post slugs do (since it's prefixed by `nav-`, would it be fine to implement a simple slugify() for labelSlug which looks like `label.toLowerCase().replace(/[^\w ]+/g,'').replace(/ +/g,'-')`?

Something weird seems to be going on;  When I watched one of the tests with video turned on (By adding the line `recordVideo: true` to the `sauceLabs` object in my config) the Karma header never updated from 'Karma - starting', but the list of browsers and browser activity did.

From https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/v0.12.31/client/updater.js#L22 it appears that, once a connection has been made, the status should have been updated.

But, the list of browsers is updated when an 'info' event is emitted: https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/v0.12.31/client/updater.js#L27

(Both of these were in `karma.js` which I assume is compiled from everything in the `client` directory?)

So I'm a little confused how we could simultaneously not be connected, and receiving events from the server.  I'd think it was just the `StatusUpdater` being naughty but you were saying you're not seeing a console log of the socket ever connecting.

In a local install of Karma I added the `connecting` and `connect_failed` events to try to track more precisely what was going on.  Unfortunately I can't get the problem to reproduce.  I've cloned Angular's repo and am currently trying to get it running tests in the hope it'll fail consistently, so I can have at it more savagely.

haha. I don't like to do that, but really there is no other contenders on the deprecation message front. I thought out it because I was trying to upgrade a CLI to the newest `ejs` and I got that warning, but had no idea which of my dozens of calls to `renderFile` caused it, since there's no location data. I eventually figured it out and then ran the script again and the message was still there, apparently from yet another call.

I had to make the `depd` module to have a sane experience correcting code as a consumer of a deprecated API (since all the other deprecation modules on `npm` didn't provide it). The main thing is that module will not work in web browsers and it has no desire to, which is why I mentioned the stuff about the dependency management (if you cannot depend on non-browser deps, then clearly it's a moot point :) ).",[],[],[],[],1538624,TimothyGu,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-21 05:06:05,2015-01-21 07:37:53,4,,70796316,2015-01-21 07:37:53,2015-01-21 07:37:53,COLLABORATOR,67512,dougwilson,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

This is because in canvas context there is no way to create a shadow of a certain color without also creating text of the same color. While in CSS you can specify multiple text-shadows, so in canvas context you need an offset so only the shadows (not the text itself) are visible. This point is valid in all cases unless you have one shadow on fully opaque text.

3) Nope, it's only the shadow being rendered to the visible portion of the screen. The text color must be 100% opaque or it will be multiplied against the shadow. It doesn't matter what color as long as it's opaque, so I just chose #000.

In Part 4. page 144 
Request Header the timeoutHint is described this way
 timeoutHint UInt32 
<blockquote>This timeout in milliseconds is used in the Client side Communication Stack to set the timeout on a per-call base. For a Server this timeout is only a hint and can be used to cancel long running operations to free resources.

Node-opcua uses timeoutHint=0 in the requestHeader by default.
In our case , the server doesn't consider a timeout=0 means no timeout as per the spec.
This is clearly a bug on the server side, that you might want to report to the vendor.

Anyway, I have put a workaround in the code, that should fix the issue.

1.	The number of DIVs increases significantly, OR
2.	The size of each DIV increases significantly (then it fails with fewer number of DIVs)
I am using Html2Canvas Plugin to convert div (containing image) to canvas. I have implemented a recursive function to convert multiple images at a time (see code below).

JavaScript
```javascript
//counter 
var div_number = 0;


function image2canvas() {
    var img2canvasObj = {
        logging:true,
        onrendered: function (canvas) {
            canvas.id = ""cvs"" + div_number;
            $(""#canvasid"").append(canvas);
     //incrementing the counter
            div_number = div_number + 1;
           
            if (div_number <= 18) {
                html2canvas($(""#tempDivforpublishplan"" + div_number), img2canvasObj);
                
            }
            if (div_number === 19) {
<Some Ajax Call>
            }
        }
    };
    html2canvas($(""#Content_to_convert"" + div_number), img2canvasObj);
}

```
The HTML for multiple images (which I am converting to canvas) is as follows. Note that I am using images as background of div elements. Each of these elements have a base64 string appended to the image URL which is used to convert the image to canvas.
HTML:
```javascript
<div id=""tempDivforpublishplan0"" style='background: url(""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo….."") 0% 0% / 634px 2266.26px; width: 634px; height: 2266.26px; position: relative; cursor: auto;'> </div>
<div id=""tempDivforpublishplan1"" style='background: url(""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo….."") 0% 0% / 634px 2266.26px; width: 634px; height: 2266.26px; position: relative; cursor: auto;'> </div>

```
When image count is more, or the size and resolution of images is high, only few images are converted properly. Remaining images are either converted partially or not converted at all. Is there any workaround which can be used to fix this issue?

This is due to the SwaggerOperation function in swagger.js.
At line 805, the SwaggerOperation stores a function in this.resource[this.nickname]:

this.resource[this.nickname] = function(args, callback, error) {
    return _this[""do""](args, callback, error);
};

The problem is that this.resource has some particular fields yet (id, name, description, basePath, etc...) so they are overwritten and this can lead to very odd behaviors of swagger.

(a)  make this.variables into an array for tracking states, and pop/push when save/restore is run.
(b)  tap into native tracking of variables—e.g.: use ""if (this.ctx[property] !== value) {"" instead of ""if (this.variables[property] !== value) {"" in CanvasRenderer.prototype.setVariable

I think option (b) would be easier, and you don't have to worry about things as much. I did a jsperf on the performance gains of using this.variables, and it's negligible on 1,000,000 checks.

This will fix issues with shadow not rendering properly in certain cases, such as this:

> By far the easiest thing to do for CORS images in IE9 is to proxy them through your domain to avoid CORs altogether.

À la this:

```js
var opts = { ... };

if ('withCredentials' in new XMLHttpRequest()) {
        opts.useCORS = true;
} else {
        opts.proxy = 'http://myproxy.example.com/proxy';
}

html2canvas( ... , opts).then( ... );
```

I think this and similar cases could be handled automatically by html2canvas if both CORS and a proxy could be specified in the options at the same time, using the proxy only as a fallback in such cases (as described at the end of [a previous comment](#issuecomment-69938064)).

1. Rename the properties (for instance enum -> enumValues, default -> defaultValue, in -> location)
This may be the cleanest solution but this means breaking the api backward compatibility, modifying the spec, the examples etc... a huge work (I would not do it myself)

2. Change the way to access every properties.
I would personally not chose this solution, it's a bit risky and less readable I think

3. Change the way to access only the impacted properties.

This is on Windows 7 64b (hmmm, maybe this is a fork issue?)
protractor 1.6.1
node 0.10.30
selenium standalone v2.44 (I think, screen dump at bottom)

My conf.js is:
```javascript
exports.config = {
	seleniumAddress: 'http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub',
	capabilities: {
		'browserName': 'chrome'
	},
	specs: ['example_spec.js']

```

The test is (this might look familiar):
```javascript
describe('angularjs homepage', function() {
  describe('todo list', function() {
	var todoList;

	beforeEach(function() {
	  browser.get('http://www.angularjs.org');
	  todoList = element.all(by.repeater('todo in todos'));
	});

	it('should add a todo', function() {
	  var addTodo = element(by.model('todoText'));
	  var addButton = element(by.css('[value=""add""]'));

	  browser.pause();
	  addTodo.sendKeys('write a protractor test');
	  addButton.click();

	  expect(todoList.count()).toEqual(3);
	  expect(todoList.get(2).getText()).toEqual('write a protractor test');
	});
  });
});
```

This is an alternative to an open pull request targeting the same issue:
https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/4835

The #4835 approach supported only 'development' and 'production' environments.

This approach supports any environment that has a matching key present in config.js,
and also goes further to check that the configuration contains the required keys.

The 'mail' key is treated exceptionally, since it is not configured for the
development and test and environments out of the box. A warning is issued if 'mail.transport'
is not set in production, but the server won't be stopped from starting up.

missing and that remains supporteed as well.",[],[],[],[],25829,markstos,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-22 01:48:34,2015-01-22 01:48:34,0,,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,1,40,0,1,0,63326e79043388b5e2cb2160da3ddefd666727c1,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,master,29412998,markstos/Ghost,issue-4825,Just a blogging platform,55829,13767,3118,JavaScript,1,0,1,1,1,,master,2013-05-04 11:09:13,2015-01-22 01:33:14,2015-01-21 11:01:44,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

There is stuff related to the debugger printed to the screen, but there is no `pause`.
Same thing for .debugger().

This is on Windows 7 64b (hmmm, maybe this is a fork issue?)
protractor 1.6.1
node 0.10.30
selenium standalone v2.44 (I think, screen dump at bottom)

My conf.js is:
```javascript
exports.config = {
	seleniumAddress: 'http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub',
	capabilities: {
		'browserName': 'chrome'
	},
	specs: ['example_spec.js']
};
```

The test is (this might look familiar):
```javascript
describe('angularjs homepage', function() {
  describe('todo list', function() {
	var todoList;

	beforeEach(function() {
	  browser.get('http://www.angularjs.org');
	  todoList = element.all(by.repeater('todo in todos'));
	});

	it('should add a todo', function() {
	  var addTodo = element(by.model('todoText'));
	  var addButton = element(by.css('[value=""add""]'));

	  browser.pause();
	  addTodo.sendKeys('write a protractor test');
	  addButton.click();

	  expect(todoList.count()).toEqual(3);
	  expect(todoList.get(2).getText()).toEqual('write a protractor test');
	});
  });
});
```

This is what I get when I run:
```

So, if you see, I am trying to do assertion check in results.then part. I have printed the response, which I am receiving. That is coming as expected. But I am intentionally trying to match with wrong value, but test case is still passing.

One of the things that Ghost 'tries' to do, is provide exceptional error messages, so we are always keen to resolve issues like the one you described where there was no error - it really doesn't fit with the kind of experience we want users of Ghost to have.

You'll see elsewhere in the startup checks file that Ghost uses a 3-part error message pattern, where the error is in red, some context follows in white, and a hint at what to do or where to go for the answer in green. It would be great if you could expand your messages to follow this.

The config and mail checks seem to me to perhaps be duplicating checks that we already have elsewhere in the application - here's the config validation: https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/config/index.js#L310

And here's the mail validation:
https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/d2d9e4aea242cec0ca39749a3fe55ce15e16c879/core/server/index.js#L106

It may well be that these things need improving to show better error messages, and the mail messaging is currently in the UI rather than on the console, so adding extra logging to the console seems like a good idea, I'm just a little concerned about having 2 very similar checks in different parts of the codebase.

Mhm, I think the syntax I posted in the comment above was correct. So in my case 'cm1' is the custom metric with index 1 on Google Analytics. My problem was that I have set the scope of the metric to ""Product"" and I didn't receive any data. Dunno why, I'm not really a Google Analytics crack. If I remember this correctly, I started receiving data after I changed the scope to 'Hit'.
Nonetheless, I decided to use a different service for collecting my custom stats, because GA didn't really fit my purpose, or maybe I just don't really understand how these custom metrics and the scopes work.

I hope I can help you with this.

Best,
Sandro

In general, a proxy is a service running on one server that allows you to access resources that live on other servers. In html2canvas, a proxy would be used to load cross-origin images via javascript. This helps circumvent browser restrictions, namely the Same Origin Policy, because the proxy is (presumably) on your own domain, so the browser is just getting some ""local"" image.

For hints on implementing one, you can check out, for example, http://apidock.com/ruby/Net/HTTP. You can essentially write a controller that listens for a request with a ""url"" parameter, fetches the URL, and returns the content. (Note that html2canvas will only use the proxy for images.)

See some sample implementations in other languages here:
https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas-proxy (Python)
https://github.com/brcontainer/html2canvas-php-proxy (PHP)

I have started the selenium server as a separate process, and I am on protractor 1.6.1 (from npm install, not from master).

@juliemr giving --seleniumAddress on the cmd to elementexplorer did the trick, thank you!  (I'm giving protractor training today. :+1:  ) But I have a bit of confusion you may be able to clear up for me.

I found that even tho I wanted to use seleniumAddress: null in my protractor.conf.js (as i'm happily using for my specs), elementexplorer could not seem to launch it, so I needed to start it myself (ele expl spat ECONNREFUSED if I had not started it). But after starting it *and* giving elementexplorer the --seleniumAddress alleviates the extra logging problem.  Q: You mention setting in a conf -- what conf is elementexplorer reading? I would like to leverage it.

Aside: There is not much doc on elementexplorer yet, but I am discovering its features and i really want to exploit its powers.  For example, I just figured out that it works as expected -- I can load my page object files with require() and hit them interactively.  Powerful stuff. Thank you.

I tried it two different ways and they're both kinda messy, so i'd appreciate any feedback you have:

the first is by adding a parallel `api.settings.read('navigation')` in `getPostPage()` This then would propagate the navigation items similar to pagination via the options parameter that gets passed through to `api.posts.browse` and from there, it would then be re-extracted into the context object in `formatPageResponse()` similar to the way pagination is.

the second is by calling `api.settings.read('navigation')` from within `formatPageResponse()` and then having that return a promise. This would require changing all its callers to execute the template rendering in a `.then()` and would require altering the method to accept parameters to merge immediately.

Although the first approach feels a bit gross to me since it's a bit tangly, but it also feels less weighty than changing the semantics of the `formatPageResponse` method.

    this.setVariable(""shadowColor"", ""transparent"").
           setVariable(""shadowBlur"", 0);
};

I should do a perf, but am running late on getting ready to leave on a trip.

1) Remove the ng-app directive
2) Manually bootstrap using this code:

```

When testing the application, add test=protractor to the web app's query string.

This will allow angular to defer bootstrapping during protractor tests and also let the web app run normally when not testing.

This is a **WIP**. I just wanted to throw the idea out there and see if there's any feedback before I start writing tests and docs.

## How to use it?

The array shuffling is done with the [knuth-shuffle-seeded](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knuth-shuffle-seeded), my fork of [knuth-shuffle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knuth-shuffle) that supports seeding.

```
mocha --randomization tests
mocha -a tests
mocha -a tests:mySeed123ee456eeed
```

```js
{
  randomizeMode: 'test'
, randomizeSeed: 'mySeed'
}
```

If your test needs to be tested in a particular order, add `noRandom`:

```js
describe.noRandom('my test', function () {
  [...]
})
```

`noRandom` plays nicely with other modifiers (although I admit the implementation is a little ugly):

```js
describe.noRandom.only()
describe.only.noRandom()
describe.noRandom.skip()
describe.skip.noRandom()
xdescribe.noRandom()
```

## Current state

Currently it only supports test-level randomization (`mode === 'tests'`), which means that only the order of tests within a suite is randomized.

## TODO

- tests
- docs
- suite-level randomization (might be added after this PR)

1. `Subject: C=FR, ST=Paris, L=Paris, O=Gandi, CN=Gandi Standard SSL CA 2`
1. `Subject: C=US, ST=New Jersey, L=Jersey City, O=The USERTRUST Network, CN=USERTrust RSA Certification Authority`

i.e. the file should look like this:

```

Reading the docs, it does only say that pre/post `resize()` would matter, but I think it's fair to expect that someone would want pre/post `rotate()` as well.

Sample code:
```
  var e = sharp(imagePath)
  	.rotate(img.rotation)
//        .resize(img.masterWidth, img.masterHeight)
        .extract(region.top, region.left, region.width, region.height);
  console.log('extract options', e.options);
  e
    .toFile(output);
```

If you run this without the `resize()` you'll see that the extract options have Pre offsets, even though it's chained after the rotation. (Moving `extract()` before the rotation gives the same output.) A work-around is to resize to the full dimensions before the extract.

Currently my code is divided up so there's a processing layer that sets up a ""brigade"" of proxy streams that the image is to be piped through, and now I need to enforce a pixel limit, sort of like http://www.graphicsmagick.org/GraphicsMagick.html#details-limit aka `gm convert -limit Pixels <number>`. What I've arrived at is roughly this:

```javascript
// inStream: Readable stream delivering the input image
// outStream: Writable stream that needs to receive the processed image
var sharp = require('sharp'),
    sharpInstance = sharp();
sharpInstance.metadata(function (err, metadata) {
    // if (err) ...
    if (metadata.width * metadata.height > areaLimit) {
        // Oh no, abandon ship...
        sharpInstance.emit('error', new Error('Pixel limit exceeded'));
    } else {
        sharpInstance.resize(...).pipe(outStream);
    }
})

inStream.pipe(sharpInstance);
```

... But that doesn't quite fit within the scheme I'm going for where each operation is encapsulated by a single proxy stream.

My first attempt ran `.pipe(outStream)` immediately, but that (perhaps predictably) caused the image to be read into memory in its entirety, then piped out.

What I would like to be able to is something like:

```javascript
var sharpInstance = sharp();
sharpInstance.metadata(function () {
    if (metadata.width * metadata.height > areaLimit) {
        sharpInstance.abort(); // Or something
    }
}).resize(...).pipe(outStream);
```

Or even:

```javascript
inStream.pipe(sharp()).limit(function (metadata) {
    return metadata.width * metadata.height > areaLimit;
}).resize(...).pipe(outStream);
```

... where specifying the limit as a number could be a shorthand.

Unfortunately, our HTML reports and screenshots are no longer working (using https://github.com/jintoppy/protractor-html-screenshot-reporter)

A few queries:

1. Looking at [boot.js](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/boot.html) for Jasmine2, it looks like an HTML reporter is included as standard. However, I can't see anything being output when I run my protractor tests. Is this something I can configure? 

2. The [Protractor reference config file](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/referenceConf.js) suggests there are more options for jasmineNodeOpts and points me to find the full list at https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm. I have not been able to find the list at https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm (or by Googling) - should this be referencing a different page?

3. Our code for the HTML reporter was as shown below (within onPrepare). Is there anything that needs to be tweaked within this code that would easily make it work for jasmine 2?

  ```
  var jasmineEnv = jasmine.getEnv();
  var HtmlReporter = require('protractor-html-screenshot-reporter');
    jasmineEnv.addReporter(new HtmlReporter({
    baseDirectory: '../tmp/screenshots'

I'm not opposed to changing the behaviour of this code. In fact, I believe
it should be changed, to throw errors more liberally and consistently. It
seems senseless squandering efforts on attempting to faithfully reproduce
old quirks ( which this change set can't achieve a perfect score for
anyway, due to rounding changes ) when it could be put into defining
sensible behaviour.

The discussion is very much in scope. This a huge bunch of changes
requested to be merged, including some amounts now overflowing to zero.
This is a bad change, made worse in the context of avoiding making good
ones.

I'd like to suggest adding a small icon next to each tag in the preview panel with an (extensible) options drop-down/modal to influence relevant/available html attributes of that tag (e.g. the class and id of all tags, target for links, etc.). Another icon on top, or next to the gear at the bottom could enable/disable this functionality, similar to the [pilcrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow) that enables its display in word processing.

The motivation here is primarily in keeping the ability to add image placeholders (and the inherent ability to drag&drop them into the preview panel), while enabling a greater degree of customization. 
An example application would be to set certain post images to a specific class to be used in a (e.g. lightbox) gallery, while leaving others out.

As we already have interaction in the preview pane (i.e. image drag-in and the image-delete button), this would fit nicely in the existing paradigm.",[],[],[],[],419944,phonique,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-23 20:17:57,2015-01-23 20:17:57,0,,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

To work around this, some (most of my performance-critical) projects use the `_with` option to disable the use of `with () {}` in template scripts and use `locals.variable` instead of `variable` in EJS files.

Recently, it has come to my attention that there is a module [`with`](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/with) that scans the source for undeclared variables and adds a shim for it, all at compile-time. This has two major effects and one side effect:

1. compile speed is a **lot** slower
2. runtime speed is a **lot** faster
3. undeclared variables are not recognized as errors but instead resolve to `undefined`, which then resolve to the empty string

```
ejs v2 old x 28,709 ops/sec ±0.09% (101 runs sampled)
ejs v2 new x 1,343 ops/sec ±1.83% (96 runs sampled)

(21 x slower)

Template benchmark:

Hrmm, yeah, the context was lost somewhere, and I was vague, but concerns should not be so readily dismissed. It's a problem with native amounts only right? It seems that _check_limits will throw when an IOU value is out of bounds.

>>> I thought it was ready to be merged

Might be worth taking stock and going back and making the tests more detailed.

I just looked at the existing limit tests and was sad to see this test (existing prior to this patch):
```
   it ('from_json less than minimum XRP', function() {
      var amt = Amount.from_json('-9000000000000000001');
      assert.strictEqual(amt.to_json(), '0');
    });
```
(This was added in the same commit that introduced errors thrown for IOUs exceeding limits it seems)

You can add `assert(isNaN(amt._value));` and see for yourself what happens here. (to_json() must call to_text() which has an `allow_nan` argument)

What a can of worms huh?

It certainly is possible, but the solution I could think of is not great and basically involves using system tools to render the font string in order to account for font size, face and decoration and measuring that. I don't like this solution because it relies on the system which is different for different developers. I haven't found a good server-side solution in pure javascript since every solution I have found relies on the browser's DOM.
If I could find an efficient way of measuring the width of a font string in pure javascript, I would then need to find an efficient way of finding the longest string. I'm thinking it would involve separating the strings of a column into different array of different styles, finding the longest string in each array, calculating the width of each longest string and then using the longest width for the column width. This would happen during the xl.write() process.

I noticed that with grunt-autoprefixer running, cmd-clicking a value set by a variable no longer linked to the variable definition, and instead linked to the rule.

This is now fixed in the dev branch. The dev branch is a complete refactor of the library (it's much faster and more efficient than the current and a lot easier to add new features to). But now I have quite a bit of testing to do. I'm hoping to push this into master tomorrow night. It will be version 0.2.0.

Right now `{{meta_description}}` returns an empty string when used inside of `{{#foreach posts}}`. On the other hand doing `{{log meta_description}}` prints the correct string to the console.

### Steps to Reproduce

This happens wherever there's a `{{#foreach posts}}`. For simplicity's sake, here are steps to reproduce this with the default theme (Casper):

1. Replace `{{excerpt ...}}` with `{{meta_description}}` in `partials/loop.hbs`
2. Visit a page with a post list (for example the frontpage) and notice the empty text instead of the post description.

I think I got a patch ready but first wanted to ask whether that's intentional or a actually bug.

The reason those checks use `process.exit(0)` is to avoid the generation of long, confusing error output and stack traces from things like npm.

Because `startup-check` is checking for a class of error/misconfiguration that is likely to be encountered only by way of a mistake in setting up the environment by users who may not be very experienced, it's really helpful to not have to wade through a hundred lines of ""stuff"" to try and figure out what went wrong.

To work around this, some (most of my performance-critical) projects use the `_with` option to disable the use of `with () {}` in template scripts and use `locals.variable` instead of `variable` in EJS files.

Recently, it has come to my attention that there is a module [`with`](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/with) that scans the source for undeclared variables and adds a shim for it, all at compile-time. This has two major effects and one side effect:

1. compile speed is a **lot** slower
2. runtime speed is a **lot** faster
3. undeclared variables are not recognized as errors but instead resolve to `undefined`, which then resolve to the empty string

Compilation benchmark:

```
ejs v2 old x 28,709 ops/sec ±0.09% (101 runs sampled)
ejs v2 new x 1,343 ops/sec ±1.83% (96 runs sampled)
```

(21 x slower)

Template benchmark:

```
ejs v2 old x 160,036 ops/sec ±1.11% (100 runs sampled)
ejs v2 old !_with x 680,884 ops/sec ±0.43% (98 runs sampled)
ejs v2 new x 631,878 ops/sec ±0.40% (102 runs sampled)
ejs v2 new !_with x 675,687 ops/sec ±0.46% (100 runs sampled)
```

The main goal is to bring jsreport into the end user's browser. This means report customization will not be exclusive job for the jsreport integrator but it will give opportunity to the end users to customize invoices or what ever other report.

We will start simple in the first phase and provide just a simple report editor similar to one in jsreport studio. Later we may build a full WYSIWYG editor on the top of it.

## Concept
External web application embedding jsreport will download some jsreport init scripts first. When the user reaches a particular page or a button application triggers opening a lightweight jsreport designer. The designer will popup in the specified placeholder or in the dialog. The user should be able to preview and customize report there and save it back.

## Designer
jsreport lightweight designer could be the same as the [playground](https://playground.jsreport.net/) simplified studio. We only need to make it smaller so it fit to the placeholder.

## Security
We want to support also the scenario where jsreport is used in the multitenant environment. For this is crucial to guarantee that one tenant cannot see the templates from the other tenant and so on. This should be at least partially supported in jsreport otherwise every application needs to implement some kind of a authentication proxy in front of jsreport.

Mirroring users from another system or calling another authentication service is maybe an overhead at least for now. Let's provide security in easier way.

First, on premise version must get some kind of an admin account authentication. Admin should be specified in the standard config.

External application then should be able to call a specific jsreport REST method to get a restricted permission token for some specified id. The id can be a tenant id or user id of the external application. Retrieved token will then used when creating and accesing jsreport. jsreport will filter by the token only objects that were create with particular id.

## Widgets
We should not stick just to pdf reports. User should be able to easily design html live widgets running in the browser because it will be quite a quick win when we already have preview mechanisms and editor. The difference will be that recipe, javascript templating engine and script evaluation will run in the browser opposite to the typical server side rendering. We will introduce a client html recipe responsible for this.

jsreport server will be just a widget storage in this scenario.  But where are widgets will be pdf printing required and a lot of work for jsreport server.

## Implementation

Tasks need to be implemented:
1. enable CORS on the jsreport
2. test a playground jsreport studio embedding into an external web applications
3. add admin user authentication through config file
4. implement restricted permissions
5. implement client side html recipe",[enhancement],[84b6eb],[0],[],2041960,pofider,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2014-09-29 18:48:55,2015-01-24 21:19:56,2,2015-01-24 21:19:56,0,,,COLLABORATOR,0,,Bot,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

It only shows ""execute async script"" and not the Cucumber step name or browser action.  Is there any configuration I can do to change the output?

I am also having two problems with Chrome and Firefox maybe you can give me some guidance.  When I launch my Angular app in Firefox from Protractor, Angular does not execute.  Thus, the Angular elements remain on the page ""{{ }}"" and the tests hang.  When running in Chrome, each browser interaction takes about ten seconds.  Any thoughts on where I should register these issues?

The assertion on the `disabled` attribute fails as the next page has already loaded.

Currently the UI sends just the bare string with no quotes around it when an API has a body parameter and comes application/json, which is not valid json.

He's not doing anything wrong, it's just an issue of the choice of variable name. A big part of separating the data object from options was to avoid having magical reserved keys (like ""filename"" or ""cache"") in your data which would actually end up being opts.

As long as we have this backward-compat shim, we can't avoid some sort of special treatment -- copying them from data to opts for backward compat. Since opts are optional, there's also the possibility that this is just someone using the new API correctly who happens to be using one of the previously reserved keys (e.g., ""filename""). There's not really a nice solution to this, so I'm inclined to remove the deprecation notices completely.

may i request changing the compression type for JSZip from default 'STORE' to 'DEFLATE'?  or alternatively, adding the abiility to pass in a config object for JSZip file() method, or a flag to switch compression types?

example:
```javascript:
xlsx.file(""[Content_Types].xml"",Content_TypesXML.end(xmlOutVars), {compression: 'DEFLATE'});
xlsx.file(""[Content_Types].xml"",Content_TypesXML.end(xmlOutVars), this.jszipOpts);

While I agree that we should make the conversion from other templating languages easier, there is simply no end for this. Jade uses `self`, for example, and it would be overkill if we have three or four (counting `l`) variables referencing the same thing. And thus, I consider not changing anything the best solution here.

I don't think I understand this sentence.

Reading through the commits is the best way to track progress; they're fairly atomic.

Currently, I can't get anything to happen (even error messages) on `ember serve`, although I did do some fiddling to get the new resolver to pick up a few of our utils.

### Playing with this branch
The goal is for the following commands to do something:
```
# First terminal
<ghost> $ node index
# Another terminal
<ghost>/core/client $ ember server --proxy http://localhost:2368
```
Visiting `http://localhost:4200` then serves up the app, some day :)

### Todos
- [ ] get `ember serve` to show something, or at least print an error
- [x] move to ember-cli app layout
- [x] move to ES6 for `ember` / `DS`
- [x] add sass/autoprfixer
- [ ] move app config to configuration/environment.js (ghost-paths needs some work to hook in to our node app's config)
- [ ] add client dependencies to ember-cli via addons / brocfile (partially done? showdown's missing)
- [ ] refactor client grunt tasks

First of all, `npm install` failed because of my `~/tmp` directory was owned by `root`, but I guess that's the fault of how `npm` (or maybe `grunt`) installs on trusty, 'cos I don't think that `~/tmp` directory existed before.

But then when I ran `grunt init`, I get these errors:

```
Loading ""docker.js"" tasks...ERROR

Loading ""jscs.js"" tasks...ERROR
>> Error: Cannot find module 'vow-fs'

Aborted due to warnings.
```

Now knowing how to fix this (I checked `ruby-sass` was definitely installed) I just continued with `grunt init --force`.

Then when I type `npm start` I get this:

```

But this PR uses very slightly different names for the `url` and `label`. I think it makes sense to remove the `label` from `labelSlug` to just have `slug`, and the same for `navUrl`.

```hbs

The code for taking a screenshot is very standard, with some wrapping around it to specify where the screenshots go.

```
...
browser.takeScreenshot().then(function (png) {
  var stream = fs.createWriteStream(directory + '/' + name + '.png');
  stream.write(new Buffer(png, 'base64'));
  stream.end();
});
...
```

When I call this from within a spec, it works perfectly.

However, I have tried to call it from within 'specDone' and while it reaches browser.takeScreenshot(), the promise never calls then() and the screenshot is not produced. No error is displayed in console either.

Here is my very simple reporter:

```
var myReporter = {
  specDone: function (result) {
    if (result.status !== 'passed') {
      screenshot.takeScreenshotOnFail(result.fullName.replace(/ /g, '_'));
    }
  }
};

jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(myReporter);
```

I just hope to have a shorter name for the locals object, `l`, `e`, and `ejs` all work (although I think `ejs` might be conflicted with `require('ejs')`). So that's why I suggested to use `it` as at least it is consistent as *something*.

First, it is unlikely for us to change the default, definitely not in EJS v2 but unlikely in EJS v3.

Grunt installed fine (`sudo npm install -g grunt`), but then, `npm install` failed because my `~/tmp` directory was owned by `root`, but I guess that's the fault of how `npm` (or maybe `grunt`) installs on trusty, 'cos I don't think that `~/tmp` directory existed before. I just fixed the permissions (`sudo chown -R robin:robin ~/tmp`) and then `npm install` succeeded.

But then when I ran `grunt init`, I got these errors:

```

Now knowing how to fix this (I checked `ruby-sass` was definitely installed) I just continued with `grunt init --force`.

Then when I type `npm start` I get this:

The short of it is that [asynchronously writing `karma.conf.js`](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/test/e2e/support/world.coffee#L38) causes the tests to be asynchronous, and as a result two tests can run at the same time.  Specifically, I can consistently cause the following to happen on my OSX and Ubuntu machines:

1. [`proxy.feature`](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/test/e2e/proxy.feature) reaches the `fs.writeFile` line
2. [`reconnecting.feature`](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/test/e2e/reconnecting.feature) reaches the `fs.writeFile` line
3. `reconnecting.feature`'s callback is called
4. `proxy.feature`'s callback is called

The result is that both `reconnecting.feature` and `proxy.feature` read from a corrupted `karma.conf.js`, causing both tests to fail dramatically.  I see three possible solutions:

1. Get cucumber.js to wait for one test to finish before starting the next
2. Make writing a file synchronous
3. Randomize the file name for what is currently `karma.conf.js` so that collisions are unlikely

Solution 1 the best of course.  I dug into how `grunt-cucumberjs` invokes the tests, and basically it's just running cucumber's [command-line script](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/master/bin/cucumber.js).  I couldn't find a cucumber flag for waiting for asynchronous tests however (though I have been using cucumber for less than 24 hours).  So this solution seems unfeasible.

Solution 3 is a terrible idea, since it exposes us to more race conditions in the future*.  So I vote that we make writing the config file synchronous.  It's a little inefficient, but it's the simplest, most future-proof solution.

In 1.3.1, the expectation is evaluated, a message is logged, and protractor pauses. However in 1.6.1, I have not seen any evidence that my callback that is passed into ````then()```` is ever called.

I also tried updating to 1.4.0 instead of 1.6.1, and I received the same issue. I have not upgraded to jasmine 2.

```
swagger-client.js:466 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'push' of undefined
```
```
 operationGroup.apis.push(operationObject);
```

here, operationsGroup.apis is undefined

I tracked this down to swagger-client.js line 458 which does:
````
operationGroup = this[tag];
````
but this.tag is not an operations group, it is the list of models (schemas) in the API.
(in this example A : Model, B : Model )

Unfortunately, this conflicts with SwaggerClient.models 

This also means that any other field of the SwaggerClient object may not be used as a tag.

This should probably be stored in this.operationGroups[tag] 
````
operationGroup = this.operationGroups.[tag];
````
so avoid conflicting with the other members of SwaggerClient (such as basePath, title, etc.)

@tmcw yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind. Agree that these should be separate implementations with performance front and center. I think most of these can be implemented to run very fast using modified variations of [turf-kinks](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf-kinks/blob/master/index.js). Throw in sweepline, or various other indexing strategies, and it should be quite performant. `contains` will probably be the most expensive.

For reference, this seems to be the exact specification that Shapely (and probably postgis, ogc, etc.) try to follow http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM

The idea of our `{{url}}` helper (at present) is that it outputs the url for the current scope - so if you're currently outputting a post, and use `{{url}}` you'll get the url for that post. Likewise for tags, and authors, etc. It makes sense that the same should happen if you're in the scope of a navigation item, because what you want to do is exactly the same - output the url for the current object.

However, calling the property `url` alone isn't enough, the url helper & urlFor method will need to be updated to handle nav objects. The navigation template should then probably use `{{url absolute=""true""}}`  by default in order to match the spec that all the urls be output in absolute form.

I hope that it is not too much extra work to make this happen.

An undocumented feature is that if the input is a filename, you can do exactly what you're trying to achieve.

You're using a Buffer, which behaves slightly differently to work around a nuance of the V8 garbage collector.

An input Buffer containing compressed image data is copied and unreferenced as soon as the first call to `toFile` (or `toBuffer` or `pipe`) is made. This is to avoid the situation where, should the memory compaction stage of the V8 garbage collector run in the time between a resize task being queued and being processed, the Buffer could move without us knowing.

In your example this means the internal reference to `imgBuffer` held by the instance of `sharp` doesn't exist by the second call to `toFile`.

To provide the API you're expecting, we'd need to change this module to hold two copies of the input Buffer in memory at the same time, one in JavaScript land and one in C++ land. The newer version of V8 and the changes to Buffer allocation in Node.js 0.11 unstable (and io.js) might improve the situation, so I'd be happy to revisit this when they stabilise.

As an aside, the default behaviour is to crop with centre gravity so you can leave the `.crop(sharp.gravity.centre)` bit out.",[],[],[],[],943232,nmec,User,COLLABORATOR,0,,[],[],2015-01-27 18:37:24,2015-01-27 19:53:40,1,,71715792,2015-01-27 19:53:40,2015-01-27 19:53:40,COLLABORATOR,210965,lovell,User,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,Bot,0,,Bot,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,[],approved,COLLABORATOR,0,0,,,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,0,0,0,,,[],[],[],0,,0,,Bot,,,deploy_key,,branch,,,deploy_key,[],[],[],0,,Bot,0,,,,0,0,,Bot,0,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],0,0,,Bot,COLLABORATOR,,,,,,

The times it doesn't crash seem to be when the system is under load from other tasks, like viewing a different folder of thumbnail images.

I'm not sure how to get a full backtrace from node, but this is from the system crash log. 
Thanks.

The inclusion of `vips_cache_trim` leads me to believe you've run into #151, which was fixed in v0.9.0.

The times it doesn't crash seem to be when the system is under load from other tasks, like viewing a different folder of thumbnail images.

I'm not sure how to get a full backtrace from node, but this is from the system crash log. 
Thanks.

manually deleting the protractor directory from node modules, doing a npm
cache clean and fresh npm install to upgrade to the latest protractor. The
reason I suggest this is because a few releases back we encountered some
strange behaviour where by previous protractor functionality seemed broken
and it turned out that the upgrade hadn't quite upgraded!

I wonder if you can suggest the most efficient way of what I'm trying to do. I'm using the [multer middleware](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) to handle user image uploads, which you can either write straight to disk, or keep as a buffer. At the moment I'm keeping it as a buffer, then looping over it to make the three thumbnails and writing them to disk. 

It sounds like I could write it to disk, read it back with sharp and create the three thumbnails in a single chain like my example above. 

I imagine the former is more memory/CPU intensive, whereas the latter is more IO.

```
beforeEach(function()
{
  browser.get('/login');
  element(by.model('loginObj.email')).click().clear().sendKeys('testUser1@example.com');
  element(by.model('loginObj.password')).click().clear().sendKeys('testPass1');
  element(by.id('loginSubmit')).click();  // After executing this line my app redirects to /user/profile
  browser.get('/profile/edit/basic'); // Go to profile edit page
});

it('should pass', function()
{
  var status = element(by.model('profBasic.status'));
  expect(status.all(by.tagName('option')).getAttribute('value')).toEqual(['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7']);
});
``` 

With this setup all tests were failing with error `No element found using locator`.  Adding `browser.waitForAngular()` after `browser.get('/profile/edit/basic');` did not help. Then I added `browser.sleep(700);` this helped but I don't like to slow my tests so I started to look for other solutions.

After some time and trying things like `browser.driver.get('http://local.dev:8080/profile/edit/basic');` I find out that adding `element(by.id('tbEditProfile')).click();` right after `browser.get` solves the problem.

Now what is the difference between going to the page by URL and clicking on anchor. This should be pretty much the same as far as tests go. Isn't it?

When I test it to see the result of `isEnabled()`, it returns `true`, when you'd expect it to return `false`.

I have tested this by calling `getAttribute('disabled')` on the same element – it returns `'true'` (as a string, not a boolean value).

We had jasminewd installed in our root node_modules\ folder. Whenever jasminewd is installed in the root, and I uninstall 1.3.1 and install 1.6.1, I get the issue.

If I uninstall jasminewd from the root node_modules\ and then uninstall protractor 1.6.1, protractor works as expected. I even tried uninstalling jasminewd and reinstalling it and then updating protractor and got the same results.

In short:
jasminewd at root. uninstall protractor, install protractor -> **problems**
jasminewd at root, uninstall jasminewd, install jasminewd, uninstall protractor, install protractor -> **problem**

jasminewd at root, uninstall jasminewd, uninstall protractor, install protractor -> **WORKS**
